# THE WORK

For 12 years, I've been the Principal Architect for Cluen's flagship recruitment platform. The job wasn't to build something and move on. It was to keep it alive—through three distinct technological shifts, 40,000+ users, 2.5M+ annual transactions, and zero catastrophic failures.

Everyone wants a system that's both stable and modern. That's the actual constraint. You don't get to choose.

The Encore Platform is the operational backbone for thousands of global employers. Downtime is not acceptable. Legacy isn't a failure. It's proof that something matters.

# THE APPROACH

Big rewrites break things. So we didn't do one.

Instead: wrap the legacy .NET core in a modern React shell. Replace the engine while the car's driving at 60mph. It's an old pattern—the Strangler Fig—but it works because it respects two things: institutional knowledge and uptime.

**How it worked:**
1. Identify the friction points (auth, reporting, bulk operations)
2. Build modern interfaces around them
3. Route traffic incrementally to the new layer
4. Decommission the legacy code only after it's proven stable

No heroics. No faith-based architecture. Just incremental replacement, verified at every step. The kind of work that doesn't produce exciting war stories because nothing fails.

# THE NUMBERS

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Uptime | 99.9% over 12 years |
| Major rewrites | 0 |
| Technology epochs survived | 3 |
| Annual users | 40,000+ |
| Transactions processed annually | 2.5M+ |

# WHAT IT MEANS

Legacy code isn't a failure. It's evidence that something works. Systems that survive a decade survive because they solve a real problem, efficiently. The architect's job isn't to erase that—it's to evolve it.

That's harder than starting over. It's also more honest.
