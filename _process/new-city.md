## How This Was Built

New City is a speculative worldbuilding system for tabletop RPG play. The constraint we took on: what if mechanics and narrative were the same system instead of separate?

Traditional RPGs separate them. A die roll determines mechanical outcome (you hit or miss). Narrative describes what happened as a result. The mechanics drive the story.

New City inverts it: what if a die roll *is* narrative discovery? What if mechanical success and narrative understanding are the same event? This required building a world where story mechanics, game mechanics, and revelation all operate through one structural logic.

### Key Decisions Made

**Cryptographic narrative structure (steganography)**

- Why chosen: Steganography hides information in plain sight. What if the world operated this way? Clues embedded in descriptions, but only visible once you have the right framework to perceive them?
- What considered: Traditional mystery-box design, hidden clues, narrative railroad
- What it enabled: Exploration as active decryption. Players discover that their growing understanding lets them perceive things that were always there. This merges mechanical progression (learning skills) with narrative understanding.

**Constraint-driven mechanics instead of optimization**

- Why chosen: Most RPG mechanics optimize for player choice and freedom. We wanted the opposite: strong constraints that produce specific character and coherent aesthetic.
- What considered: Maximum flexibility, player choice as primary, modular mechanics
- What it enabled: Coherent world. Constraints aren't limitations—they're the material for design. What emerges from constraint is more interesting than what emerges from open choice.

**Modular system design with clear dependencies**

- Why chosen: The world needed to work at multiple scales (personal relationships, faction politics, urban environment). Modularity let us maintain coherence across scales without centralizing everything.
- What considered: Single unified system, hierarchical organization, emergence-only design
- What it solved: Scalability without losing coherence. Each module can function independently while still relating to other modules through clearly defined interfaces.

**Documentation-as-artifact**

- Why chosen: The system is research, not just a product. Making the research visible (decision rationale, constraint logic, failed experiments) becomes part of what we're offering. The methodology is as valuable as the playable result.
- What considered: Finished game product, hidden-system design, design documentation only
- What it enabled: Transparency about how complex systems actually work. Players can see the thinking that created the world they're navigating.

**Multi-platform thinking from the start**

- Why chosen: The world needed to work differently depending on platform (tabletop RPG, novel, TTRPG podcast, solo play). Each platform reveals different aspects of the system.
- What considered: Single reference implementation, platform-agnostic rules, written-first design
- What it solved: Depth. Each platform forces different design tradeoffs. Those tradeoffs revealed insights specific to each platform. The research got richer.

**Narrative-mechanical integration as core design**

- Why chosen: Traditional design builds narrative to fit mechanics or mechanics to fit narrative. We wanted them to emerge together from the same constraint structure.
- What considered: Narrative-first (constrains mechanics), mechanics-first (constrains narrative), separate systems
- What it enabled: Genuine coherence. When narrative and mechanics come from the same logic, they reinforce each other instead of competing.

### What Didn't Work (and Why We Fixed It)

**Early iteration: Story-first design**

We started with a narrative concept—a city with political factions and individual character arcs—then tried to design mechanics that served that story.

What happened: The mechanics felt external to the story. Die rolls determined outcomes, and we had to narratively explain them. The system felt brittle. Player actions that didn't fit the predetermined narrative either got ignored or broke the story.

How we fixed it: Flipped it. Started with mechanical constraints (what can players do? what systems govern outcomes?). Built narrative that emerges from those constraints. The story became a property of the system, not something imposed on it.

The insight that stuck: Emergence beats authorship. A world generated by systematic rules is more coherent (and more surprising) than a world that's pre-authored.

**Early iteration: Too many variables**

We tried to account for everything. Faction politics, individual character arcs, environmental factors, supply chain economics, weather, time of day. The system became so complex that it was opaque.

What happened: GMs couldn't predict outcomes. Players couldn't understand how decisions mattered. The system was sophisticated but unusable.

How we fixed it: Ruthlessly cut variables. Keep only what directly affects player decisions. Let other variables emerge implicitly. A simpler system is more understandable and more playable.

The insight that stuck: Complexity is a property of emergence, not a design goal. A simple system with clear rules generates complex outcomes naturally.

**Early iteration: Player choice as primary goal**

We designed to maximize player agency—the most options, the most freedom. This was supposed to create emergent gameplay.

What happened: It created incoherence. Players could make choices that contradicted the world's logic. The world felt arbitrary. "I can do anything" turned out to be less interesting than "I can do specific things that matter."

How we fixed it: Reduced player options but increased consequence density. When you choose something, it really matters. The world responds. Your choices reshape the system. This was more interesting than having more options.

The insight that stuck: Agency emerges from consequence, not from options. A player with three meaningful choices is more agentive than a player with thirty neutral ones.

**Early iteration: Single platform implementation**

We designed for tabletop RPG play. The system worked fine in that context, but some of the best design was invisible in play.

What happened: Players experienced emergent story without understanding the system creating it. The methodology wasn't visible. We were hiding the research.

How we fixed it: Documented the system heavily. Created a solo-play version where the system's logic is more visible. Built it for podcast/audio play where narrative is primary but mechanical structure is audible.

The insight that stuck: The same system under different constraints reveals different aspects of itself. Multi-platform design deepens understanding.

### Technical Architecture Notes

**Cryptographic narrative layer**

The world contains encoded information that players unlock through play. A location description is the plaintext. A character's backstory is encoded in how they respond to specific topics. Environmental details contain hints that only make sense after certain revelations.

Mechanically: Player actions (skill rolls, relationship development, investigations) are the "key" that decrypts information. Success doesn't just accomplish the goal—it reveals something about the world that was always true but previously incomprehensible.

**Modular entity relationships**

The world contains 40+ distinct entities (NPCs, factions, locations, forces). Rather than centralizing all relationships, each entity has:
- Local relationships (who I interact with directly)
- Environmental relationships (what systems I participate in)
- Temporal relationships (when I'm relevant)

This modularity means adding new entities doesn't require rewriting the whole system. Each new entity slots into existing relationship patterns.

**Constraint propagation through system layers**

Constraints flow from world principle → faction goals → character drives → session decisions. Each layer is affected by the constraints of layers above and below.

A constraint at the world level (e.g., "magical power is scarce") cascades: factions compete for it, characters make choices around it, players encounter it in specific ways. Tracing this propagation shows how a simple constraint generates complex gameplay.

**Playtesting feedback loop as documentation**

Every playtest reveals what's working and what's obscure. Rather than hiding failed experiments, we document them: what assumption failed? What did we learn? How did we adjust?

This feedback documentation becomes part of the design artifact. It shows the evolution from theory to practice.

### The Constraints That Shaped Everything

**Speculative design freedom**

Unlike a commercial game, New City doesn't need to be marketable, profitable, or widely playable. This freed us to pursue structural purity over accessibility.

We could say: "This system requires a sophisticated GM. It requires players who want to discover systems, not just experience story. If that's not your preference, this isn't your game."

That constraint paradoxically expanded what was possible. Without commercial pressure, we could be specific instead of general.

**Platform diversity as design requirement**

The world needed to work across tabletop, solo play, written form, audio form. Each platform has different affordances.

Tabletop RPG is mechanical: dice, turn structure, simultaneous information management. Solo play is narrative: single agent, written interaction, internal reflection. Audio is performance: vocal clarity, temporal pacing, audible system logic.

Building for all three forced coherence. If something only works in one medium, it's not fundamental to the system—it's a platform artifact.

**Research visibility as commitment**

The system is research, so hiding methodology would be contradictory. This meant documenting decision-making, failed experiments, constraint logic.

This constraint shaped the artifact: we spent as much time documenting *why* as implementing *what*. The methodology became part of what we delivered.

**Artistic expression over game polish**

The goal wasn't a finished game—it was a system that expresses design thinking through emergent gameplay.

This constraint meant: prioritize elegance of logic over accessibility, prioritize methodological clarity over feature completeness, prioritize revealing structure over hiding seams.

### What We'd Do Differently

If we restarted, the core integration (cryptographic narrative, constraint-driven mechanics, modular structure) would hold.

What we'd adjust: We'd invest more in the solo-play version earlier. That format forced clarity about how the system actually works. Doing it later meant rewriting explanations we'd already done.

We'd also spend more time on the podcast/audio iteration early. Hearing the system in narrative form reveals what's elegant and what's confusing in ways that reading doesn't.

Most importantly: We'd commit earlier to the research-visibility stance. We hemmed and hawed about whether to expose the methodology. Committing fully earlier would have shaped our documentation and design choices.

The principle that held: **Constraint is creative fuel.** Every design decision that accepted a limitation and built from it produced more interesting results than decisions that tried to eliminate limitations.

What this taught us: Applied to all other work. Savepoint Protocol's power comes from the constraint of neurodivergent attention. Aiden-Jae's coherence comes from the constraint of handmade production. Order of the Aetherwright's durability comes from the constraint of limited freedom within systems.

Systems designed *against* constraints are fragile. Systems designed *from* constraints are durable and surprising.
