# Phase 5 Progress Summary: Content Rewrite with Master Builder Voice

**Status:** In Progress - First Pass Complete for Landing Page & Savepoint Protocol

---

## What's Been Completed

### ✅ Landing Page (Homepage Manifesto)
**File:** `_data/about.json` → pages.manifesto

**What it now clearly articulates:**
- **WHO:** Systems architect. Visual Communication foundation + construction discipline
- **WHAT:** Helps creative teams build narrative, visual, and technical systems that hold vision through constraint
- **WHO FOR:** Creative teams, neurodivergent households, builders under constraint
- **DIFFERENT:** Integrates (not layers), first principles (not reactive), proof everywhere, constraints as material, portable systems

**Key improvement:** Went from generic "help creative teams" to specific differentiation around Narrative Solvency, Three Systems integration, and structural proof (12 years at 99.9%, household systems, scaled methodology)

**Live:** Yes - renders at homepage with full differentiation visible

### ✅ Protocols Tier Introduction
**File:** `_data/protocols.json` → collectionCopy

**Enhancement:** Shifted from generic "load-bearing systems" to specific origin story: "Frameworks I designed from first principles because existing tools failed under real constraint."

**Tagline:** "First principles. Stress-tested. Still working."

### ✅ Savepoint Protocol - Narrative Enhancement
**File:** `_data/protocols.json` → artifacts.savepoint-protocol

**Changes:**
- **Summary:** Enhanced to emphasize cognitive governance + marking inflection points (not just decision logging)
- **Problem:** Deepened with authentic diagnosis from extracted thinking; added hospital stay example
- **Thinking:** Added recon beacon metaphor + team navigation metaphor; emphasis on marking moments not summarizing
- **Authentic voice:** "You are a recon team navigating intellectual terrain"

**Result:** Transforms from technical description to narrative of how breakthrough thinking actually happened

**Live:** Yes - renders on `/protocols/` tier page with extracted thinking visible

## Full First Pass Plan (Remaining Work)

### Phase 5A: Protocols (2 of 4 remaining)

#### Order of the Ætherwright
- Enhance summary: Emphasize separating framework from identity
- Deepen problem: Add boundary question + framework capture risk
- Rewrit thinking: Showcase Jungian complex model + externalization through lineage
- Proof: Add integration protocols + institutional context benefits

#### AI DevOps Workbench
- Reframe: From "deterministic governance" to "structural impossibility"
- Problem: Explicit agent contradiction metrics + hallucination gaps
- Thinking: Add conventions + symbol-index + enforcer architecture
- Proof: 40+ workflows metrics + 87% fewer contradictions

#### Portable Agency
- Problem: Deepen corporate dependency risk
- Thinking: Add physical ownership emphasis + resilience through ownership
- Structure: Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Ollama specifics
- Proof: Family operations proof + "not a weekend project" authenticity

### Phase 5B: Applied Systems (All 5 projects)

#### Aiden Jae: Retail Brand Architecture
- Focus on Narrative Solvency: How luxury positioning becomes operational advantage
- Enhance textile/photography system story
- Add "accessible luxury" integration across Shopify UX + grid logic

#### Encore: Enterprise Platform
- The 12-year proof: Strangler Fig pattern + zero unplanned downtime
- Shift from legacy platform to evolutionary architecture
- Add Design Systems work as proof of visual coherence at scale

#### Altrueism: Brand Reconception
- Focus on transparency as structural requirement (not marketing)
- Information architecture as brand proof
- Contrast: from fragmented to operationally coherent

#### Everyday Gold: Regulatory as Design Material
- Swiss grid + trademark research integration
- Regulatory constraints as forcing function
- Label system architecture

#### Modernist Homestead: Executive Function Systems
- Zero-willpower systems proof
- Culinary modularity across five traditions
- Technology as clarifying lens (not replacement for tradition)

### Phase 5C: Practice Tier (Focus on methodology stress-testing)

#### New City: Narrative Integration
- Thematic-mechanical integration = theme IS the mechanic
- Kishōtenketsu + Hero's Journey integration
- Knowledge graph as narrative infrastructure

#### MathOnTape: Signal Flow as Composition
- Music production as systems thinking proof
- Constraint (signal flow rules) + creativity (composition)

#### Photogeography: Constraint as Clarification
- Format-locked archive = constraints concentrate meaning
- Square format + metadata = active perception

#### Other Practice Projects
- The Deep Cuts (active listening through DJ methodology)
- Echo & Bone (archetypal systems as reproducible)
- Versagrams (typography + AI as parametric constraint)

### Phase 5D: Three Systems Integration Across All Content

- Ensure each project clearly identifies which systems it deploys
- Show integration patterns (narrative → visual → technical)
- Emphasize methodology proof across domains

---

## Content Rewrite Principles (Applied So Far)

### 1. **Problem First, Authentic**
- Lead with actual structural fragmentation (not surface symptoms)
- Use specific examples from extracted thinking
- Show what was broken before the solution

### 2. **Breakthrough Moment Visibility**
- Surface the diagnostic shift ("Instead of X, ask Y?")
- Show alternatives considered and rejected
- Include key metaphors that unlocked the thinking

### 3. **Why It Works - Deep Reasoning**
- Not just "metrics prove it works" but "here's why it structurally must work"
- Show principles that transfer across contexts
- Connect to first-principles thinking

### 4. **Master Builder Voice**
- Concrete nouns first (textile, glyphs, squares) before abstract (luxury, coherence, constraint)
- Short declarative sentences for clarity; longer only for causal chains
- Materials vocabulary (load-bearing, joints, chassis, foundation)
- No jargon that hasn't been earned

### 5. **Methodology Proof Visible**
- Each project shows how first-principles approach works
- Protocols: designs from scratch
- Applied Systems: methodology proven at scale
- Practice: principles stress-tested across domains

### 6. **Integration Over Separation**
- Show how narrative, visual, technical work as one system (not layered)
- Emphasize where constraint in one system forces clarity in another
- Connect systems through operational logic, not decoration

## Next Immediate Step

**Recommended:** Apply same pattern to Order of the Ætherwright next (since Savepoint is foundational + Order is the complementary system that ran Encore together). This will establish the pattern for remaining protocols.

Then move systematically through Applied Systems, using each project to show methodology proof at different scales (enterprise, luxury brand, household, rebrand, personal infrastructure).

---

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Landing page clarity:** WHO/WHAT/WHO FOR/DIFFERENT clearly articulated
- **Narrative consistency:** Problem → Thinking → Structure → Proof arc
- **Voice authenticity:** Concrete before abstract, no unjustified jargon
- **Extracted thinking usage:** Key metaphors, breakthrough moments woven in
- **Proof visibility:** How each project proves methodology works

---

## Build Status

- ✅ Site builds cleanly
- ✅ JSON updates render without errors
- ✅ Enhanced thinking visible on tier pages
- ✅ Landing page manifesto deployed

**Ready for:** Next protocol rewrites to be merged into JSON files
