## The Format

Systematic visual taxonomy of purpose-built vehicles. Baja bugs, rat rods, overlanders, choppers, lowriders.

**The constraint:** 12-column grids. Industrial palette. DIN and Akzidenz-Grotesk typography. Technical layouts that read like engineering documentation.

**The premise:** Purpose-built vehicles are problems solved in steel. Every bolt, every weld, every line carries structural weight. The poster documents what the machine learned from its environment.

## What It Proves

**Documentation is respect.**

When you use technical precision—engineering blueprints, grid systems, industrial typography—you're showing what you believe about the subject: that it deserves serious treatment, not styling.

Same principle scales:
- Encore: Technical architecture documented with the same precision
- Portable Agency: Infrastructure treated as legitimate system
- AI DevOps Workbench: Workflow documented as reproducible protocol

How you document something shows what you believe about it.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- Why purpose-built vehicles?
- What's the connection to your own work?
- Which vehicle types resonate most and why?
- Any specific pieces that worked or didn't?
-->

## The Work

Vehicle taxonomy established. Each poster documents what the vehicle learned in solving its specific problem: desert survival, rock crawling, durability across distance, freedom expression, cultural identity made mobile.
