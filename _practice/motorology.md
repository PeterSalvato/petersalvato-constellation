## Purpose-Built Vehicles

Poster series exploring vehicles designed for terrain and mission—Baja bugs, rat rods, overlanders. Not automotive fantasy. Engineering made visible.

## The System

12-column grids. Technical precision. Industrial color: greys, blacks, metallics with bright accents. Typography stays condensed and functional—DIN, Akzidenz-Grotesk. Layouts echo engineering drawings.

## The Research

Each vehicle is a solution to a specific problem. Desert survival. Rock crawling. Long-distance durability. The posters document what the vehicle learned.

## The Archive

Purpose leaves traces. Build a vehicle for sand dunes and the dunes reshape the vehicle. The poster shows that conversation.
