## Purpose-Built Vehicles

Purpose-built vehicles are problems solved in steel. Baja bugs, rat rods, overlanders, choppers, lowriders—each one engineered for something specific. Not styling exercises. Engineering made visible.

Every vehicle type answers a question about what people actually want: How do I survive the desert? How do I reject convention? How do I claim freedom? How do I claim identity? The machine embodies the answer.

Form follows function. But function expresses philosophy. The Baja bug whispers "unrestrained adventure." The rat rod shouts "anti-establishment defiance." The chopper declares "personal freedom." The lowrider announces "cultural identity made mobile."

## The System

12-column grids. Technical precision. Industrial palette—greys, blacks, metallics, bright accents where they matter. Typography built for purpose: DIN, Akzidenz-Grotesk. Condensed. Functional. Layouts read like engineering blueprints because vehicles *are* blueprints made manifest.

Design language doesn't decorate the emotion of a vehicle type. It reveals it. The poster shows what the machine learned.

## The Format

Posters. Primary output. Expandable through POD—trading cards, apparel, home goods. Audience: people who read design seriously, auto enthusiasts, subculture historians.

Vehicle taxonomy established. Thematic framework locked. Ready to build.

Each vehicle solves a specific problem. Desert survival. Rock crawling. Durability across distance. The poster documents what the vehicle learned in solving it.

## The Archive

Purpose leaves traces. Build a machine for sand dunes and the dunes reshape the machine. The poster shows that conversation between engineer and environment.
