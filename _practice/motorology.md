## Purpose-Built Vehicles

An aesthetic and cultural study of purpose-built vehicles—Baja bugs, rat rods, overlanders, choppers, lowriders. Not automotive fantasy. Engineering made visible. Each vehicle type is a statement about human desire: adventure, rebellion, freedom, survival, identity.

Form follows function, but function expresses philosophy. The Baja bug says "unrestrained adventure." The rat rod says "anti-establishment defiance." The chopper says "personal freedom." The lowrider says "cultural identity made mobile."

## The System

12-column grids with technical precision. Industrial color palette: greys, blacks, metallics with bright accents. Typography condensed and functional—DIN, Akzidenz-Grotesk. Layouts echo engineering blueprints because vehicles *are* blueprints made manifest.

Each poster expresses the core emotion of the vehicle type, not just its visual form. The design language reinforces the "spirit" of the machine.

## The Format

Posters as primary output, expandable through POD to trading cards, apparel, home goods. Audience: design lovers, auto enthusiasts, subculture historians. Detailed vehicle taxonomy established; thematic framework locked. Ready for execution.

Each vehicle is a solution to a specific problem. Desert survival. Rock crawling. Long-distance durability. The posters document what the vehicle learned.

## The Archive

Purpose leaves traces. Build a vehicle for sand dunes and the dunes reshape the vehicle. The poster shows that conversation.
