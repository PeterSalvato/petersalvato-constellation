## Creatures from Evidence

Poster series documenting cryptids through Swiss grid structure. Not conjecture—visual research grounded in a modular system.

## The System

4-column and 6-column grids with asymmetrical text placement. Large cryptid illustrations carry mysterious weight. Typography stays minimal and precise. Each poster treats the creature as a documented artifact.

## The Method

Dark, moody tones. High contrast. The grid holds mystery without explaining it away.

Each poster exists as standalone research, but together they form an archive of the creatures that occupy the edge of known territory.

## The Work

Cryptozoology as visual discipline. The creatures exist. The poster is how you see them.
