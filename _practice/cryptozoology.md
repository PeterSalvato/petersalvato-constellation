## Creatures from Evidence

A pseudo-academic exploration of cryptids using serious-looking scientific aesthetics with playful subversion. Treats cryptids as part of a legitimate field of study—blending folklore, scientific presentation, and cultural fascination.

The joke is the juxtaposition: everything looks rigorous on the surface. The subject matter reveals the humor. Field guide aesthetics, vintage scientific illustration, mid-century sci-fi visuals presenting creatures that don't exist.

## The System

4-column and 6-column grids with asymmetrical text placement. Large cryptid illustrations carry mysterious weight. Typography stays minimal and precise—appearing scholarly and detached. Each poster treats the creature as a documented artifact, complete with fabricated provenance and pseudo-scientific taxonomy.

Visual language draws from field guides, conspiracy theory aesthetics, and archival documentation. The deadpan presentation is the entire joke.

## The Format

Posters as primary output. Expandable through POD to trading cards, stickers, postcards, apparel. Audience ranges from cryptid enthusiasts to design lovers who appreciate the subversive wit underneath the serious presentation.

Concept locked. Ready for execution.

Dark, moody tones. High contrast. The grid holds mystery without explaining it away.

Each poster exists as standalone research, but together they form an archive of the creatures that occupy the edge of known territory.

## The Work

Cryptozoology as visual discipline. The creatures exist. The poster is how you see them.
