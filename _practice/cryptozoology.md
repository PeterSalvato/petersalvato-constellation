## The Format

Pseudo-academic poster series. Creatures that don't exist, presented with scholarly rigor.

**The constraint:** 4-column grids. Taxonomic labeling. Field guide aesthetics. Archival presentation—dark, high contrast, deliberate restraint.

**The premise:** What if you treated cryptids with the same visual rigor as legitimate zoological subjects? Not tongue-in-cheek, not credulous. Just serious documentation of imaginary things.

## What It Proves

**Form determines credibility.**

Apply rigorous grid systems to imaginary subjects and suddenly they feel real. The structure isn't decorative—it's the mechanism of believability. The creatures exist *within* the format. The form makes them present.

Same principle scales:
- Everyday Gold: Regulatory compliance becomes first-class design content
- Aiden-Jae: Photography system makes craft visible at scale
- Sentimentology: Swiss grids make emotion navigable

Structure creates credibility regardless of content.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- Why cryptids specifically?
- What drew you to the field guide format?
- What were the actual design decisions?
- Any specific pieces that worked or didn't?

## The Work

A visual archive of creatures that occupy the edge of known territory. Each poster: standalone document. Together: a taxonomy of the impossible, made present through precision.
