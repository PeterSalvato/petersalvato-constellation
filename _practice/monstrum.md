## Kaiju as Social Commentary

Research into how large creatures function in culture—not as entertainment but as language.

A kaiju emerges when a society has something to say but no words for it. The creature *is* the statement.

## The System

Treating kaiju narratives as case studies. What anxiety produces this creature? What does its shape reveal? How does its destruction mirror or resist the culture that imagines it?

## The Work

Monsters teach you what a society fears most. Not the surface fear. The deep one.

Each creature becomes a diagram of collective consciousness. You can read the culture in the shape of the thing it spawns.
