## What It Is

Most writers write outlines. I architect dependencies.

New City is a stress test. A fictional city with 40+ entities — districts, transit systems, hierarchies, resource flows — all mapped relationally. Not a setting. A directed graph. The kind of city that exists in the relationship between supply and consumption.

The operating principle: resources flow from the periphery (Lower Wards) through a hierarchical transit network to the center (Upper Districts). Wealth concentrates. Supply lines harden. And then infrastructure fails.

## The First Story

**"The Keeper and the Veil"**

A transit strike disconnects the Upper Districts from their supply chains. The narrative stress-tests the system: what happens when infrastructure breaks? How do social hierarchies respond to scarcity? What does power actually mean when you can't get food?

Everything's mapped. Character dependencies, plot nodes, cascading failures. The city reveals itself through pressure.

## The Structure

Forty entities in a directed graph. Transit systems representing supply chains. Event cascades triggered by a single node collapse. Economic principles tested to failure.

Modular narrative fabrication — each story arc is a self-contained stress test that can be composed into larger sequences. Savepoint Protocol integration keeps the narrative state versioned across drafts.

It's not metaphor. It's operational architecture expressed as narrative.

## Status

The dataset is built. The first sequence is mapped. Ready to write.
