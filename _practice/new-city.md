## Narrative Fabrication

Speculative fiction project. Not a traditional book but a "Fabrication System" designed to minimize creative pressure through "Mechanical Placement."

A neurodivergent protagonist moving from a high-surveillance city to a hidden community.

## The Structure

Framework: Nested Kishōtenketsu (four acts, each containing four sub-beats). Fabrication System: YAML headers define the sensory "contract" before writing.

## The Implementation

Prose as an assembly problem. YAML-driven scene "contracts" define entry conditions and somatic registers before drafting. Uses Somatic Gating v1.0.

## The Result

A complete 64-beat narrative roadmap ready for drafting. A reproducible method for high-fidelity creative output with zero systemic burnout.
