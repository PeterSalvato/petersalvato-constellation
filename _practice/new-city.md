## Where It Started

NewCity is foundational infrastructure. It's where recursive system thinking translated into working mechanics—before Savepoint Protocol, before the Order of the Ætherwright, before the constellation architecture itself. A novel and game that models what happens when infrastructural systems fail at the load-bearing level.

## The Problem

The structural fragmentation: **How do you encode a story's theme into mechanics rather than just dramatize it?** Most stories treat theme and mechanics as parallel tracks—mechanics tell the plot; theme is what readers extract afterward.

The diagnostic question: **What if the theme IS the mechanic?** What if narrative structure itself revealed the story's central insight?

## The Thinking

The breakthrough: **Thematic-mechanical integration.** NewCity doesn't just *tell* a story about incremental system failure; the story *mechanics* operate as incremental system failure.

Collapse narratives typically dramatize the endpoint. **NewCity models the actual physics: incremental degradation.** Infrastructure fails in stages. People restructure around the failure. New systems emerge from adaptation pressure. Henka—neurodivergent, hypersensitive to system state—survives not through domination but through reading the environment at a resolution others can't match.

The integration point: **The protagonist's survival mechanic mirrors the story's structural mechanic.** Henka learns by reading system states. The reader learns by reading how narrative structure itself shifts in response to pressure.

## The Structure

**Macro:** Three-act structure following the Hero's Journey template. Act II subdivides into distinct phases. Four load-bearing narrative sections.

**Micro:** **Each section operates as a Kishōtenketsu cycle—setup, development, reversal, resolution.** Why not Western three-act? Because Kishōtenketsu prioritizes perspective recalibration over antagonistic collision. The character doesn't overcome obstacles; the character's *understanding of the system* shifts. This matches the theme: survival through reading system states, not fighting them.

The choice of Eastern structural logic over Western proves the principle: **Form follows the story's ontology, not the writer's default patterns.**

**Geography:** Brooklyn/Sunset Park as the model site. Layered survival zones. Industrial and residential infrastructure interpenetrating. The geography does narrative work.

## The System

This wasn't written through willpower. It was engineered. The method reduces creative pressure to zero through mechanical specification.

**Fabrication:** Prose as construction assembly. YAML-driven scene contracts specify entry conditions and somatic registers before any draft work begins. You assemble the narrative rather than discover it. Mechanical placement kills burnout at the source.

**Epistolary Elements:** System logs. Encoded communications. Corporate records. Information fragments that expose the world's structural logic to the reader.

**Somatic Gating v1.0:** Emotional states function as load-bearing architectural elements. Not obstacles to work around. Actual structural components.

## The Result

A 64-beat narrative roadmap. Reproducible method for high-fidelity creative output with zero burnout incidence. Proof that narrative operates as a system—as engineerable as infrastructure itself. The origin fractal: every downstream method traces back to these mechanics.
