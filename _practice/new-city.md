## Where It Started

New City is where recursive system thinking translated into working creative mechanics—before Savepoint, before Order, before the constellation. A tabletop RPG that proves methodology transfers from enterprise systems into narrative and game design. A laboratory for stress-testing first-principles thinking in a creative domain.

## The Problem

**How do you encode a game's central theme into mechanics rather than just narrate it?**

Most games have theme and mechanics as parallel tracks—theme says "secrets and revelation," mechanics are just combat and resource management. The theme is window dressing on generic systems. The breakthrough question: **What if the mechanics ARE the revelation system? What if learning about the world requires decryption?**

The structural diagnosis: Theme and mechanics are typically separated. You write a story about hidden truths, then build combat encounters that have nothing to do with uncovering those truths. The player experiences the theme through exposition, not through the actual act of playing.

**New City's core constraint:** Make the revelation system *inseparable* from the mechanical system. Make the way players discover information prove the game's theme.

## The Thinking

### Workshopping & Alternatives

Peter tested three design approaches and rejected two:

**1. Card Game (Magic-like model)**
- Rejected because: Too conventional, doesn't reflect the mystery/revelation theme through mechanics
- The problem: Card play doesn't force the experience of hidden information becoming revealed

**2. Tabletop RPG (D&D-like model)**
- Better thematic fit, but mechanics were still generic
- The problem: Standard RPG mechanics (roll for success/failure) don't encode the "revelation through intentional action" concept

**3. Cryptographic Mechanics (Selected) ✓**
- The breakthrough: **Cryptography isn't flavor—it's the epistemological system the game is about**
- Realization: *What if the only way to learn about the world is through decryption?*
- The key shift: Learning isn't a narration—it's a mechanical action. Discovery is *earned through intentional effort*.

### The Key Insight: Physical Instantiation

The final integration: **App-based QR code system as the physical manifestation of the core mechanic.**

Peter's insight: The app isn't a "cool add-on." It's the **physical instantiation of hidden information becoming revealed through intentional player action**. Scanning a QR code IS the act of discovering something about the world. The mechanic and the theme are identical.

This meant:
- Theme: "Information is hidden until you search for it deliberately"
- Mechanic: "You scan a QR code to unlock encrypted text about the world"
- These aren't separate—they're the same action

## The Structure

**Macro-level:** Four load-bearing narrative sections, each operating as a Kishōtenketsu cycle (setup → development → reversal → resolution).

**Why Kishōtenketsu over Western three-act?** Because it prioritizes perspective recalibration over antagonistic collision. Henka doesn't *overcome* the system failure—her *understanding of the system* shifts. This mirrors the game's central mechanic: survival through reading state, not through force.

The choice of Eastern structural logic isn't aesthetic. It's proof of first-principles thinking: **Form follows ontology, not convention.** Every section structure mirrors what Henka is learning. The reader/player experiences the same perceptual shifts she experiences.

**Geography:** Brooklyn/Sunset Park as load-bearing design material. Layered survival zones. Infrastructure interpenetrating. Physical constraint generates system failure, which generates character pressure, which reveals the mechanical reality: you survive by reading system state at higher resolution than others.

## The Engineering

This wasn't written through inspiration or willpower. It was engineered to eliminate creative pressure while maintaining fidelity.

**Mechanical Fabrication:**
- YAML-driven scene contracts specify entry conditions and somatic registers before any draft work
- You assemble the narrative rather than discover it through trial-and-error
- Mechanical placement removes the requirement for emotional inspiration to generate narrative

**Information Architecture:**
- System logs, encoded communications, corporate records as primary narrative material
- The city's failure pattern becomes *visible through data*, not through exposition
- Players discover truth through reading fragments, not through being told

**Somatic Gating v1.0:**
- Emotional states function as load-bearing architectural elements, not obstacles
- Henka's ADHD, anxiety, sensory sensitivity aren't character disabilities—they're the mechanisms through which she reads system state
- Sensory overload is data. Dysregulation is an early warning system
- The narrative architecture makes neurodivergence *mechanically functional*

## What This Proves

**Methodology stress-tested in creative domain.**

Same first-principles approach that runs Encore for 12 years (diagnose structural problem → find integration point → make the structure prove the concept) works identically in:
- Enterprise platforms (Encore)
- Brand architecture (Aiden Jae, Altrueism)
- Household systems (Modernist Homestead)
- **Narrative systems (New City)**

The principles transfer. The methodology holds. Constraint concentrates meaning. Structure enables authenticity. Thematic-mechanical integration proves that **the story is the system—not story layered on top of system.**

A 64-beat reproducible narrative roadmap. Zero burnout methodology. Proof that narrative operates with the same rigor as infrastructure.
