## The Work

Most writers write outlines. I architect dependencies.

New City is a stress test. A fictional city with 40+ entities — districts, transit systems, hierarchies, resource flows — all mapped relationally. Not a setting. A directed graph. The kind of city that exists in the relationship between supply and consumption.

The operating principle: resources flow from the periphery (Lower Wards) through a hierarchical transit network to the center (Upper Districts). Wealth concentrates. Supply lines harden. And then infrastructure fails.

## The Approach

**Relational Architecture.** Forty entities in a directed graph. Transit systems representing supply chains. Economic principles tested to failure. The city is built as a system, not described as a place.

**Narrative Stress Testing.** The first story — "The Keeper and the Veil" — disconnects the Upper Districts from their supply chains via a transit strike. What happens when infrastructure breaks? How do social hierarchies respond to scarcity? Everything's mapped: character dependencies, plot nodes, cascading failures.

**Modular Fabrication.** Each story arc is a self-contained stress test that can be composed into larger sequences. Savepoint Protocol integration keeps narrative state versioned across drafts. Event cascades triggered by a single node collapse.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| City entities | 40+ |
| Entity types | Districts, transit, hierarchies, resource flows |
| Graph type | Directed, relational |
| First story | "The Keeper and the Veil" |
| Integration | Savepoint Protocol (versioned narrative state) |

## What It Proves

It's not metaphor. It's operational architecture expressed as narrative. The city reveals itself through pressure — the same way any system does. Build the dependencies first, then break one node and watch what cascades.
