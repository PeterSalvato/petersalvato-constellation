## Where It Started

NewCity is foundational infrastructure. It's where recursive system thinking translated into working mechanics—before Savepoint Protocol, before the Order of the Ætherwright, before the constellation architecture itself. A novel and game that models what happens when infrastructural systems fail at the load-bearing level.

## The Problem

Collapse narratives typically dramatize the endpoint. NewCity models the actual physics: incremental degradation. Infrastructure fails in stages. People restructure around the failure. New systems emerge from adaptation pressure. Henka—neurodivergent, hypersensitive to system state, learning through direct perception—survives not through domination but through reading the environment at a resolution others can't match.

## The Structure

**Macro:** Three-act structure following the Hero's Journey template. Act II subdivides into distinct phases. Four load-bearing narrative sections.

**Micro:** Each section operates as a Kishōtenketsu cycle—setup, development, reversal, resolution. This Eastern structural logic prioritizes perspective recalibration over antagonistic collision. It works.

**Geography:** Brooklyn/Sunset Park as the model site. Layered survival zones. Industrial and residential infrastructure interpenetrating. The geography does narrative work.

## The System

This wasn't written through willpower. It was engineered. The method reduces creative pressure to zero through mechanical specification.

**Fabrication:** Prose as construction assembly. YAML-driven scene contracts specify entry conditions and somatic registers before any draft work begins. You assemble the narrative rather than discover it. Mechanical placement kills burnout at the source.

**Epistolary Elements:** System logs. Encoded communications. Corporate records. Information fragments that expose the world's structural logic to the reader.

**Somatic Gating v1.0:** Emotional states function as load-bearing architectural elements. Not obstacles to work around. Actual structural components.

## The Result

A 64-beat narrative roadmap. Reproducible method for high-fidelity creative output with zero burnout incidence. Proof that narrative operates as a system—as engineerable as infrastructure itself. The origin fractal: every downstream method traces back to these mechanics.
