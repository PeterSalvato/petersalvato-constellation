## Mission

I help creative teams clarify their vision and build the systems that make it hold.

The work spans vision diagnosis—pulling out what's actually there when intent is fragmented—and systems architecture: the narrative, visual, and infrastructure that let vision survive real-world deployment.

Whether starting from scratch or reconceiving what's broken, the method is the same: go to first principles, understand what should actually be built, then build it to last.

---

## What This Site Demonstrates

This site is not just a portfolio. It's a **working document** of the methodology itself. Every design decision—the structure, the navigation, the copy, the information architecture—demonstrates the principles described in the Protocols, proven in the Applied Systems, and researched in Practice.

The Colophon you're reading is meta: it explains how the site explains itself. This is recursive design—documentation that proves the methodology through its own structure.

---

## The Narrative Architecture

The site tells one story through three tiers of evidence.

### Main Story
**"I design systems from first principles that clarify vision and hold under constraint."**

### Tier 01: PROTOCOLS (Red)
"Here's what I designed from first principles."

Original conceptions. Not reactive. Deliberate architecture. Each protocol proves something about how systems actually work: **Savepoint Protocol** (decision governance survives context loss), **Order of the Aetherwright** (creative coherence holds at scale), **AI DevOps Workbench** (multi-agent orchestration becomes reproducible), **Portable Agency** (digital autonomy works locally).

### Tier 02: APPLIED SYSTEMS (Blue)
"Here's proof the methodology works everywhere."

Same methodology, different constraints:
- **Original builds** (Aiden-Jae, Everyday Gold, Modernist Homestead) — Proof from-scratch design holds
- **Enterprise scale** (Encore, 12 years, 99.9% uptime) — Proof methodology works long-term under load
- **Client rebrand** (Altrueism) — Proof methodology works reconceiving broken systems
- **Consultancy positioning** (Joinery) — Proof integration of three disciplines creates category distinction

### Tier 03: PRACTICE (Green)
"Here's where I research and stress-test the principles."

Active exploration across domains. Each project tests whether the principles hold in lower-stakes creative environments: narrative systems (New City), signal flow protocols (MathOnTape), format-driven perception (Photogeography), archetypal systems (Echo & Bone), parametric generation (Versagrams), active listening (The Deep Cuts).

### The Artifact Arc
Every project (Protocol, Applied System, Practice) tells the same story:
1. **Problem/Conception** — What gap I saw. What I designed.
2. **Thinking** — Why this structure. What principles underlie it.
3. **Structure** — How it's built. What the mechanisms are.
4. **Proof** — What it proves about how systems work. What survived.

This structure is recursive. The site uses it. The Colophon uses it. Even this explanation uses it.

## The Content Architecture

The site organizes all content through a JSON-driven system that mirrors the narrative structure.

### Master Collections & Data Files
**_protocols/ collection** — 4 Protocol artifacts (Savepoint, Order of the Aetherwright, AI DevOps Workbench, Portable Agency)
**_systems/ collection** — 6 Applied System artifacts (Encore, Aiden Jae, Altrueism, Everyday Gold, Modernist Homestead, Joinery)
**_practice/ collection** — 12 Practice artifacts + Colophon
**_data/ JSON files** — Navigation, index, contact information

Each JSON file contains:
- **Tier copy** — What this tier proves
- **Tier template** — How to render the tier landing
- **Artifacts** — Each project's story (summary, image, full sections)
- **Artifact template** — Shared narrative arc (problem → thinking → structure → proof)

### Why This Structure
Content isn't just stored—it's **structured as story**. When you visit `/protocols/`, you see cards pulled from the JSON, each summarizing a design story. When you visit `/protocols/savepoint-protocol/`, you read the full story, structured by the same architecture.

This is content as system. Not decoration. **Architecture that tells the story.**

## Strategic Positioning

### The Reframe: Creative First

Most designers and systems architects position themselves as "problem solvers" or "system architects." The original positioning was "I diagnose structural problems and build systems to solve them."

That's true but incomplete. It leads with deficit, not with capability.

**The repositioning:** Creative first. The work is built with creative teams to hold their vision in the face of execution constraints. The second service — if the vision itself is broken or unclear — is diagnosis and positioning work.

This changes who listens. It attracts creative founders and design leaders, not crisis management. It names the actual value: keeping the thing coherent across deployment.

**The term:** "Narrative Solvency" — the infrastructure ensuring that a brand story doesn't break when it hits technical reality. Companies hiring "brand storytellers" at $200k+ aren't looking for writers. They're looking for someone who builds narrative infrastructure. That's this work.

### Three Systems Output Channels

All work flows through three output channels. Not roles. Not departments. Three kinds of artifacts that get made:

**1. Narrative Systems** — Brand story, strategic positioning, world-building. The infrastructure that prevents narrative drift when execution hits constraints. In Aiden Jae, "accessible luxury" isn't a tagline. It's baked into photography, UX, product logic. In Altrueism, "radical transparency" drives information architecture. In New City, a knowledge graph holds the narrative. The story is load-bearing.

**2. Visual Systems** — Identity, typography, design systems. Swiss grid thinking applied to interfaces, brands, archives. This is where the SVA lineage shows up directly. Visual form as structural logic. Constraint as the teacher. In Photogeography, locked aspect ratios force different composition. In Versagrams, parametric rules generate emergence. In Everyday Gold, regulatory constraints become design material.

**3. Technical Systems** — Engineering, platforms, infrastructure. UX architecture. The code and systems that run reliably enough that creative work can happen on top. Encore: 12 years, 99.9% uptime. Savepoint: CLI tool for cognitive scaffolding. Portable Agency: homelab infrastructure. Modernist Homestead: household operational systems.

The best work requires all three working together. The Three Systems page documents how they integrate.

## The Voice Protocol

### Foundation: SVA + Construction Sites

The voice comes from two sources that sound nothing alike but rest on the same principle:

**School of Visual Arts (SVA):** Learned Visual Communication as a structural discipline. Swiss grid systems. Typographic hierarchy as information architecture. Massimo Vignelli, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Emil Ruder. The understanding that visual form is load-bearing — not decoration.

**Construction sites:** Learned that structures hold or they don't. The difference is in the joints. Load paths matter. Precision isn't a value — it's a material constraint.

These aren't metaphors. They're the same principle applied to different domains: constraint generates clarity. Precision enables emergence. Structure holds intent.

### Voice Rules

**Master Builder voice.** Direct. Concrete. Specific. Materials and joints, not abstractions. Lead with what was built. Then why. Then what it survived.

**Concrete before abstract.** "Typography is load-bearing" before "Visual Communication is structural." "We built Encore on the Strangler Fig pattern" before "This is evolutionary architecture."

**No jargon that hasn't been earned.** No "paradigm," "leverage," "innovative," "synergy," "passionate," "empower," "journey," "disruption." Every term should appear because the work requires it, not because marketing uses it.

**Every sentence passes the peer test:** Would you say this out loud to someone you respect? Not a client. Not an audience. A peer who knows the work.

**Avoid:** Performance, self-mythologizing, fluff, hedging language, false modesty, invented terminology.

## Content Methodology

### The Substance Extraction Problem

Initially, case studies felt abstract and distant from the actual work. Rich conversations and decisions existed in brainstorm notes and decision logs, but the final case studies read as generic.

**The root issue:** Substance wasn't being extracted before voice shaping. The writing was trying to sound polished instead of being grounded in concrete thinking.

### The Two-Stage Pipeline

**Stage 1: Substance Extraction**
- Read through all source material (conversation transcripts, decision logs, design notes)
- Extract the actual problem (not the abstract diagnosis, but the concrete fragmentation)
- Extract the actual thinking (the breakthrough, the constraint that generated the solution)
- Extract the integration point (where insight and implementation converge)
- Extract the proof (what survived, what broke, what held)
- Structure as: Problem → Solution → Mechanics → Proof

**Stage 2: Voice Shaping**
- Take the extracted substance
- Apply Master Builder voice protocol
- Make concrete nouns land first
- Remove any marketing language that snuck in
- Verify against peer test: would you say this?

The mandatory order matters. Stage 1 → Stage 2. Never skip extraction. The voice layer goes on top of substance, not instead of it.

### Making Strategic Thinking Visible

Each case study now makes visible the *diagnostic process*, not just the final answer.

**The structure for Applied Systems and Practice:**

1. **The Problem** — Where does this fragment? What constraint is biting?
2. **The Thinking** — What breakthrough reframe made the solution visible? What constraint generated the insight?
3. **The Integration Point** — Where do narrative, visual, and technical logic converge?
4. **Why This Works** — What principles hold this together? Why does it survive pressure?

This structure does two things:
- It shows the thinking process (the actual value-add)
- It makes visible that problem-solving is systematic, not magical

## The Architecture

### Three Tiers

The site organizes work by intent across three altitude levels:

- **Protocols** (red, altitude 01) — Governing logic and cognitive firmware. Prerequisites. Savepoint Protocol, Order of the Aetherwright, AI DevOps Workbench, Portable Agency. These define how everything else gets built.

- **Applied Systems** (blue, altitude 02) — Production deployments under constraint. Enterprise, commercial, personal, consultancy. Validated by performance: Encore, Aiden Jae, Altrueism, Everyday Gold, Modernist Homestead, Joinery.

- **Practice** (green, altitude 03) — Systemic research and expression. Low-stakes, high-frequency creative environments. Protocols stress-tested under variable conditions: New City, MathOnTape, Photogeography, The Deep Cuts, Echo & Bone, Versagrams.

### Faculty Weighting (RGB)

Each project carries three domain weightings shown as colored dots:

- **Red (Logic)** — Governing principles, structural rules, conceptual frameworks
- **Blue (Utility)** — Function, performance, technical depth, operations
- **Green (Surface)** — Craft, expression, aesthetic, presentation

A project with `faculty: ["red", "blue", "green"]` requires all three. A project with `["blue"]` is primarily technical. This signals which discipline is load-bearing for that particular work.

### Output Systems Tagging

Each project is tagged with which three systems it deploys:

- **Narrative** — Brand story, strategic positioning encoded into operations
- **Visual** — Identity, typography, design system coherence
- **Technical** — Engineering, platforms, infrastructure

Most significant projects use all three. This tagging makes visible that this isn't just design work or engineering work — it's structural work where intent survives deployment.

## Technical Foundation

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---|
| **Generator** | Jekyll 4.4.1 (native SCSS compilation) |
| **Styling** | Custom SCSS (no utility framework) |
| **Typography** | EB Garamond (prose), Rubik (sans-serif structure), Space Mono (monospace code) |
| **Layout** | Fixed 250px sidebar + main content. Always side-by-side. No mobile stacking. |
| **Collections** | _protocols/, _systems/, _practice/ |
| **Data** | JSON (navigation, index, contact, legend) |
| **Automation** | Liquid templates auto-generate navigation from collection files |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub Pages deployment |
| **Institutional Memory** | Savepoint Protocol applied to site decisions |

### Why These Choices

**Jekyll, not WordPress:** Static generation means no database, no plugins, no attack surface. The source files ARE the source of truth. Git history captures every decision.

**Custom SCSS, not Tailwind:** The typographic system and grid logic are explicitly visible in the styles. Changes to the design system are readable as changes. Utility frameworks hide the underlying logic.

**Fixed sidebar navigation:** Every page shows the full structure. Context is always visible. The navigation IS part of the design, not a responsive menu that collapses.

**JSON for data:** User preference. More readable than YAML in this context. The structure of the data reflects the structure of the thinking.

**Liquid template automation:** New projects in the collections automatically appear in navigation. The system is extensible without manual config changes.

## What This Site Proves

1. **Vision diagnosis works** — Fragmented intent can be pulled into sharp focus through first-principles thinking.

2. **Systems architecture works** — Narrative + Visual + Infrastructure working together hold creative vision under real-world pressure.

3. **The methodology scales** — Proves at multiple scales:
   - Single person (Savepoint Protocol, 12 years on Encore, Portable Agency)
   - Teams (Order of the Aetherwright, creative coherence at scale)
   - Enterprises (Encore, 40,000+ users, 2.5M+ transactions annually)
   - Client work (Altrueism rebrand)
   - Consultancies (Joinery, design-engineering integration positioning)
   - Original builds (Aiden Jae, Everyday Gold, Modernist Homestead)
   - Research (12 Practice projects across domains)

4. **The principles are portable** — Work in narrative, visual, infrastructure, music, photography, game design, family systems.

5. **Documentation of process is part of the value** — This Colophon. The narrative architecture. The design decisions visible in the site structure. Understanding how something was built teaches more than seeing the finished thing.
