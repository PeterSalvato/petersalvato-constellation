## What This Is

This site is a working demonstration of the systems it describes. The same architectural discipline applied to Encore, Savepoint, and the Modernist Homestead governs how this portfolio is built, organized, and maintained.

## The Architecture

### Three Tiers

The site organizes work by intent:

- **Protocols** (red) — The governing logic and cognitive firmware. Savepoint Protocol, Order of the Aetherwright, AI DevOps Workbench, Portable Agency. These are prerequisites — the foundational logic that dictates how everything else gets built.

- **Applied Systems** (blue) — Production deployments under constraint. Encore, Aiden-Jae, Everyday Gold, Altrueism, Modernist Homestead. Systems validated by their performance in enterprise, commercial, and personal environments.

- **Practice** (green) — The discipline of systemic research and expression. New City, MathOnTape, Photogeography, The Deep Cuts, Echo & Bone, Versagrams. Protocols stress-tested in low-stakes, high-frequency creative environments.

### Technical Foundation

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---|
| **Generator** | Jekyll 4.4.1 |
| **Styling** | Custom SCSS (no utility framework) |
| **Typography** | EB Garamond (prose), Rubik (structure), Space Mono (code) |
| **Layout** | Fixed sidebar + main content. Always side-by-side. |
| **Collections** | protocols, systems, practice |
| **Data** | JSON (navigation, index, holding company) |
| **Version Control** | Git + Savepoint Protocol |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages |

### Voice

Master Builder protocol. Rigorous. Systemic. Full reference at `/docs/voice-protocol.md`.

Every page follows one rule: lead with what was built, then why, then what it survived. No jargon that hasn't been earned. Every sentence should survive the question: "Would you say this out loud to someone you respect?"

## What It Proves

The site is the proof. The person who builds durable, autonomous infrastructure should have a portfolio that functions as durable, autonomous infrastructure.

The architecture is visible. The scaffolding isn't hidden. That's the colophon: what the methodology looks like when applied to itself.
