## The Work

Thematic mapping and archetypal research. A project that asks: can the structural patterns underneath mythology, alchemy, and occult systems be extracted and applied as a design vocabulary?

Not mysticism. Taxonomy. The same way a biologist classifies organisms by structure rather than appearance, Echo & Bone classifies archetypal patterns by their structural function in narrative and visual systems. These systems survived centuries not because they're mystically true but because they're structurally useful.

## The Approach

**Structural Extraction.** Strip the mystical overlay. What remains is a set of structural patterns — transformation arcs, polarity pairs, elemental taxonomies, cyclical progressions. Document these as abstract structures independent of their source tradition.

**Symbolic Taxonomy.** Organize the extracted patterns into a usable reference. Each pattern gets a structural description (what it does), application domains (where it applies), and compositional rules (how it combines with other patterns).

**Application Testing.** Test the taxonomy against real design and narrative problems. Can alchemical stages (nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo) structure a brand transformation arc? Can elemental taxonomies organize a character system? Can polarity pairs generate visual tension in a layout?

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Source systems | 3+ (mythology, alchemy, occult/esoteric) |
| Tarot as taxonomy | 78-node classification of human experience |
| Alchemical stages | 4 (nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo) |
| Astrological grid | 12-sector domain partition |
| Pattern types | Transformation arcs, polarity pairs, elemental taxonomies, cycles |

## What It Proves

Archetypal systems are information architectures. When treated as structural vocabularies rather than belief systems, they become design tools — ways to organize complexity that have been stress-tested across centuries of human use.
