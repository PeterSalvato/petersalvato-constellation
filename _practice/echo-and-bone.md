## Archetypal Systems

Archetypes aren't decoration. They're structural patterns. They appear across cultures. They appear across millennia. Same shapes, different surface. The Hero. The Shadow. The Wise Old Man. The Trickster.

These aren't symbols. They're load-bearing structures in narrative and visual systems.

Map them and you can build with them deliberately instead of accidentally.

## The Work

Thematic mapping grounded in alchemical and archetypal systems. Not mysticism. Structural analysis. How human consciousness organizes meaning. How narrative and visual systems resonate because they're built on archetypal logic.

## The Result

A working vocabulary for archetypal pattern applicable across domains. When you understand the Hero's journey as structure, not story, you can apply it to brand narratives, interaction design, product architecture. The pattern is the skeleton. The specific story is the flesh on the bones.

Echo & Bone is the framework. The proof that archetypes are engineering tools, not decorative concepts.
