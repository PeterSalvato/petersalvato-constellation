## The Format

Archetypal patterns as structural engineering. Symbols as operational systems.

**The framework:** 27 reference points across cultures and centuries. Visual systems built on symbolic investigation.

**The premise:** The same patterns repeat across cultures—Hero, Shadow, Wise Old Man, Trickster. Not because they're mystical, but because they're structural solutions to how human perception organizes complexity. Archetypes work the way girders work.

## What It Proves

**Symbols are operational, not decorative.**

Archetypes carry meaning the way structural materials carry load. They're not character templates—they're how meaning itself gets structured. Understanding the architecture enables application.

Same principle scales:
- Order of the Aetherwright: Archetypal patterns as identity governance
- New City: Character archetypes as narrative infrastructure
- Monstrum: Cultural encoding through creature architecture

Pattern is framework. Story is specific assembly. Application follows from understanding.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- What led you to archetypal research?
- Connection between visual work and structural thinking?
- How does this connect to Aetherwright?
- Specific archetypes or patterns that proved the concept?
-->

## The Work

Visual documentation of archetypal logic. Typography and symbol expressing how meaning gets structured. Proof that archetypes are engineering, not mysticism.
