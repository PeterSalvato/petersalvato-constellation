## Words for Feeling

Dictionary of feelings without common names. Not poetry. Definition as visual discipline.

## The System

Each entry: the word, its origin or construction, what it names, what it feels like. Typography varies to match the emotional texture of each term.

Some definitions run sparse. Others accumulate detail. The form follows the feeling.

## The Work

Language shapes perception. Give someone a word and they can see the feeling that was always there, unnamed.

These posters are definitions made physical. Once you see the word, you can't unsee the feeling.
