## Words for Feeling

A typographic poster series exploring rare words describing specific emotions—creating a visual dictionary of feelings without common names. Not poetry. Definition as visual discipline.

These are real words from various languages and cultures describing feelings that English lacks vocabulary for. Sonder. Hiraeth. Mono no aware. Mamihlapinatapai. The project collects them, defines them, and visualizes them typographically.

## The System

Each entry: the word, its origin, what it names, what it feels like. Typography varies to match the emotional texture of each term. Modernist typography paired with color schemes that embody the feeling.

Some definitions run sparse—single words or fragments. Others accumulate detail. The form follows the feeling. Subtle, sophisticated design reflecting each word's linguistic and emotional landscape.

## The Format

Poster series expandable through POD to prints, merch. Part of personal explorations alongside Cryptozoology, Motorology, Versagrams. Showcases linguistic curiosity merged with design thinking. Format and approach established; ready for word/emotion selection phase.

## The Work

Language shapes perception. Give someone a word and they can see the feeling that was always there, unnamed.

These posters are definitions made physical. Once you see the word, you can't unsee the feeling.
