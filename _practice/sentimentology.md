## Words for Feeling

A typographic poster series mapping rare words that name specific emotions—building a visual dictionary of feelings English doesn't have words for. Not poetry. Definition as structure.

Real words from different languages and cultures naming feelings that English abandoned. Sonder. Hiraeth. Mono no aware. Mamihlapinatapai. The project collects them, defines them, makes them visible.

## The System

Each poster: word, origin, what it names, what it feels like. Typography shifts to match the emotional weight of each term. Modernist typography paired with color that carries the feeling.

Some definitions compress to fragments. Others build outward. Form follows feeling. Clean, direct design that maps each word's linguistic and emotional territory.

## The Format

Poster series. Expandable through POD into prints, merchandise. Part of a larger investigation alongside Cryptozoology, Motorology, Versagrams. Shows how linguistic curiosity and design thinking build on each other. The system works. Ready for word and emotion selection.

## The Work

Language shapes perception. Give someone a word and they can see the feeling that was always there, unnamed.

These posters are definitions made physical. Once you see the word, you can't unsee the feeling.
