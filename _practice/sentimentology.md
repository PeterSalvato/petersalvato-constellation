## The Format

Swiss grid systems applied to emotional terrain. Words from global languages that name feelings English abandoned.

**The constraint:** Modernist precision. No decorative moves. Typography doesn't illustrate emotion—it maps it. Color doesn't decorate emotion—it locates it.

**The premise:** Sonder, Hiraeth, Mono no aware, Mamihlapinatapai. Emotional experiences we can't articulate because we lack the verbal anchors. What if emotion could be mapped as rigorously as geography?

## What It Proves

**Structure and sentiment aren't opposites.**

Apply cartographic rigor to emotion and the feeling becomes navigable. You can enter it, move through it, understand its terrain. The grid doesn't suppress emotion—it clarifies it.

Same principle scales:
- Modernist Homestead: Emotional wellbeing held by structural systems
- Savepoint Protocol: Cognitive state made visible through syntax
- Order of the Aetherwright: Symbolic systems holding what can't be said directly

Rigor produces depth. Decoration produces surfaces.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- Which words/emotions drew you in?
- What's the actual typographic approach?
- Connection to broader language/meaning work?
- Any specific pieces that worked or didn't?

## The Work

Typographic series where Swiss precision meets emotional precision. Each poster: a rare word, its origin, its definition, its terrain mapped visually. Definitions made physical.
