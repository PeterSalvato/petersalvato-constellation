## Words for Feeling

A typographic poster series mapping rare words that name specific emotions—building a visual dictionary of feelings English doesn't have words for. **Not poetry. Definition as structure.**

## The Problem

The structural fragmentation: **Language shapes perception. Feeling without naming remains invisible.** English abandoned certain emotional territories—words other languages kept. The result: emotional experiences we can't articulate because we lack the verbal anchors.

## The Thinking

The diagnostic question: **How can you make unnamed feeling visible without resort to illustration or sentiment?**

Answer: **Make the word itself the structure.** By collecting rare words from different languages (Sonder, Hiraeth, Mono no aware, Mamihlapinatapai), defining them precisely, and mapping their emotional territory through typography and color, feeling becomes navigable and shareable.

The breakthrough: **Emotion as geographic territory, not as aesthetic expression.** Each word gets: origin, definition, what it names, emotional landscape. Typography and color form the terrain. **Form follows the emotional weight, not the designer's taste.**

## The System

Each poster: word, origin, definition as structure, emotional cartography. Typography shifts to match the emotional weight of each term. Modernist typography paired with color that carries the feeling—not decoration, but structural choices that map the terrain.

Some definitions compress to fragments. Others build outward. Clean, direct design mapping each word's linguistic and emotional territory.

## The Format

Poster series. Expandable through POD into prints, merchandise. Part of a larger investigation alongside Cryptozoology, Motorology, Versagrams. Shows how linguistic curiosity and design thinking build on each other. The system works. Ready for word and emotion selection.

## The Work

Language shapes perception. Give someone a word and they can see the feeling that was always there, unnamed.

These posters are definitions made physical. The work proves: **Rigor produces depth; decoration produces surfaces.** Once you see the word, you can't unsee the feeling.
