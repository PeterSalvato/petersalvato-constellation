## DJ as Active Listening

A book teaching the craft of DJing as a path to deeper music appreciation and active listening. Not for aspiring club or festival DJs—for anyone who wants to hear music more completely. DJing is a methodology for understanding music structure.

## The Method

DJing teaches you to listen. Selection, transition, sequence, timing—these aren't performance tricks. They're the mechanics of how music works.

Learn selection: you hear. Learn transition: you recognize structure. Learn sequence: you see how meaning assembles from order. Learn timing: you grasp rhythm's multiple scales.

This isn't passive consumption. You become an active architect of meaning the moment you move between records.

## The Teaching

Interactive methodology for developing deep music literacy. Possible formats: book, journal, workshop series, visual narrative approach. Concept established; positioned within creative practice for development.
