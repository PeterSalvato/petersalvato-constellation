## DJ as Active Listening

A book teaching the craft of DJing as a path to deeper music appreciation and active listening. Not for aspiring club or festival DJs—for anyone who wants to hear music more completely. DJing is a methodology for understanding music structure.

## The Method

DJing teaches you to listen. Selection, transition, sequence, timing—these aren't performance tricks. They're how you understand music's architecture. By learning to move between records, you learn to hear the joints in music. You become an active participant in musical meaning-making.

Understanding selection teaches you to hear. Understanding transition teaches you to recognize structure. Understanding sequence teaches you how meaning emerges from order. Understanding timing teaches you rhythm operates at multiple scales.

## The Teaching

Interactive methodology for developing deep music literacy. Possible formats: book, journal, workshop series, visual narrative approach. Concept established; positioned within creative practice for development.

By learning to move between records, listeners become active participants in musical meaning-making. Understanding selection teaches you to hear.
