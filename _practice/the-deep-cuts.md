## Narrative Sequencing

Research into how narrative arcs are constructed through selection—directly informing routed UI architecture.

## The System

Concert poster series encoding full setlist metadata inside a grid-governed typographic system. Maximum data density without breaking readability.

## The Research Value

Directly informs UI/UX navigation patterns and information architecture.
