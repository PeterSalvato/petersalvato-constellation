## DJ as Active Listening

A book teaching the craft of DJing as a path to deeper music appreciation. Not for aspiring club or festival DJs—for anyone who wants to hear music more completely.

## The Method

DJing teaches you to listen. Selection, transition, sequence, timing—these aren't performance tricks. They're how you understand music's architecture.

## The Teaching

By learning to move between records, listeners become active participants in musical meaning-making. Understanding selection teaches you to hear.
