## What It Is

A study in typographic systems and parametric constraints. Fixed grids stress-tested against variable content to find where typography holds and where it breaks.

The question: within a locked set of grid parameters — column width, baseline grid, type scale, margin ratios — how much content variation can the system absorb before it fails? And what does "failure" actually look like in a typographic system?

## The Approach

### Fixed Parameters
Every Versagram starts with the same locked grid: column count, gutter width, baseline increment, type scale ratio, and margin proportions. These don't change. They're the structure.

### Variable Content
The content changes every time. Different text lengths, different languages, different content types — headlines, body text, captions, data tables, pull quotes. Each piece of content is a load test on the grid.

### Failure Documentation
When the grid breaks — text overflows, rhythm collapses, hierarchy becomes ambiguous — the failure is documented. What broke? Why? Was the grid too rigid, or was the content genuinely incompatible? Each failure teaches something about the relationship between structure and content.

## The Principle

Typography is load-bearing. A typographic system isn't decoration — it's the structure that holds content in a readable, navigable form. Versagrams test that structure the way an engineer tests a beam: apply increasing load until you find the failure point. Then you know what the system can actually carry.

## What It Proves

Constraint-driven typographic forms hold under more variable input than intuition suggests. The failures are instructive — they reveal which parameters are truly structural (baseline grid, column width) and which are cosmetic (specific typeface, color). The rigid grid produces more visual variety, not less, because the constraints force creative solutions at the content level.
