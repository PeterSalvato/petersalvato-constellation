  Experimental exploration in how typography and AI-generated imagery work together to convey feeling. Not decoration—the intersection of constraint and generation.

  Typographic rules establish structure. AI-generated images respond to that structure, creating meaning at the boundary between precision and emergence.

  Verse made visible. The proof that feeling can be encoded systematically.

## Typography and Feeling

Experimental exploration in how typography and AI-generated imagery work together to convey feeling. Not decoration—the intersection of constraint and generation.

## The System

Typographic rules establish structure. AI-generated images respond to that structure, creating meaning at the boundary between precision and emergence.

## The Result

Verse made visible. The proof that feeling can be encoded systematically.
