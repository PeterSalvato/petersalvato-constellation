brief_explainer: |
  Experimental exploration in how typography and AI-generated imagery work together to convey feeling. Not decoration—the intersection of constraint and generation.

  Typographic rules establish structure. AI-generated images respond to that structure, creating meaning at the boundary between precision and emergence.

  Verse made visible. The proof that feeling can be encoded systematically.

## The Problem

The structural fragmentation: **How do you visualize feeling in a design system without being decorative, sentimental, or therapeutic?**

Most emotional design relies on illustration or photography—adding images to evoke feeling. But that's compensatory. It doesn't solve the structural problem: **Emotion needs structure, not illustration.**

## The Thinking

The diagnostic question: **What constraint would concentrate emotional meaning?** Answer: **Apply Swiss grid systems' precision to emotional terrain.**

The breakthrough: **Emotion becomes cartographic.** By applying typographic rigor and grid discipline to emotional territory, you create **emotional geography**—feelings become navigable, shareable, reproducible without requiring illustration to carry the meaning.

This means:
- Typographic rules establish structure (constraint)
- AI-generated images respond to that structure (emergence)
- Meaning appears at the boundary between precision and generation

The integration point: **Feeling becomes buildable.** Not encoded through aesthetics. Constructed through systematic structure.

## Typography and Feeling

Typography is constraint. AI imagery is response. Together they build feeling the way architecture builds space—through measurable relationships, not sentiment.

## The System

Typographic rules are load-bearing. They establish grid, rhythm, proportion. AI-generated images don't decorate these rules; they inhabit them. Meaning emerges where the structure meets what fills it.

## Why This Works

The confidence comes from recognizing: **Rigor produces depth; decoration produces surfaces.**

This approach works because:
1. **Structural Integrity** – Built on typographic systems (Swiss grids), not aesthetics
2. **Authentic Integration** – Feeling and structure aren't separate; they're unified
3. **Recursion Capacity** – The system scales because meaning lives in constraint, not image selection
4. **Truth Alignment** – Emotion becomes visible as structure, not hidden behind imagery

## The Result

Feeling becomes buildable. Not encoded—constructed. The same way a cantilever proves engineering works: the system stands or it doesn't.
