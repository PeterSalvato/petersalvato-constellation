  Experimental exploration in how typography and AI-generated imagery work together to convey feeling. Not decoration—the intersection of constraint and generation.

  Typographic rules establish structure. AI-generated images respond to that structure, creating meaning at the boundary between precision and emergence.

  Verse made visible. The proof that feeling can be encoded systematically.

## Typography and Feeling

Typography is constraint. AI imagery is response. Together they build feeling the way architecture builds space—through measurable relationships, not sentiment.

## The System

Typographic rules are load-bearing. They establish grid, rhythm, proportion. AI-generated images don't decorate these rules; they inhabit them. Meaning emerges where the structure meets what fills it.

## The Result

Feeling becomes buildable. Not encoded—constructed. The same way a cantilever proves engineering works: the system stands or it doesn't.
