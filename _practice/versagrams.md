## The Format

Typography and AI as co-authors. Verse made visible through structured collaboration.

**The constraint:** Typographic rules establish structure. AI-generated imagery responds to that structure. Neither decorates the other—both work from the same constraint.

**The premise:** What if typography and AI could collaborate as equals? Swiss grids, rhythm, proportion establish the emotional terrain. AI generation inhabits that terrain, extending what typography alone can't express.

## What It Proves

**Constraint generates emergence.**

Meaning lives in *how* they relate, not in either alone. The feeling isn't in the type. The feeling isn't in the image. The feeling is the relationship between them.

Same principle scales:
- Aetherwright: Human + AI collaboration through structural protocol
- AI DevOps Workbench: Multi-agent systems unified by reproducible structure
- Sentimentology: Typography mapping emotional terrain

Rigor produces depth. Decoration produces surfaces.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- What led to typography + AI as format?
- Which verses/pieces worked best?
- What did you learn about AI collaboration through constraint?
- Connection to broader AI workflow thinking?

## The Work

Typographic constraint + AI emergence. Neither partner decorates—both co-author. Verse made visible not through aesthetics, but through disciplined collaboration.
