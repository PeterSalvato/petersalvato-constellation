## Parametric Typography

Study in typographic systems and parametric constraints. Fixed grids stressed against variable content.

## The System

Typographic study where grid and typography rules are fixed. Content input varies. Constraint-driven forms hold under variable input.

## The Proof

Constraint-driven systems can handle variable input without breaking. This underpins your enterprise work.
