## The Work

A study in typographic systems and parametric constraints. Fixed grids stress-tested against variable content to find where typography holds and where it breaks.

The question: within a locked set of grid parameters — column width, baseline grid, type scale, margin ratios — how much content variation can the system absorb before it fails? And what does "failure" actually look like in a typographic system?

## The Approach

**Fixed Parameters.** Every Versagram starts with the same locked grid: column count, gutter width, baseline increment, type scale ratio, and margin proportions. These don't change. They're the structure.

**Variable Content.** The content changes every time. Different text lengths, different languages, different content types — headlines, body text, captions, data tables, pull quotes. Each piece of content is a load test on the grid.

**Failure Documentation.** When the grid breaks — text overflows, rhythm collapses, hierarchy becomes ambiguous — the failure is documented. What broke? Why? Was the grid too rigid, or was the content genuinely incompatible? Each failure teaches something about the relationship between structure and content.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Fixed parameters | 5 (columns, gutters, baseline, type scale, margins) |
| Content variables | 5+ (length, language, type, hierarchy, density) |
| Load test method | Increasing content variation until failure |
| Key finding | Baseline grid and column width are structural; typeface and color are cosmetic |
| Output | More visual variety from rigid constraints, not less |

## What It Proves

Constraint-driven typographic forms hold under more variable input than intuition suggests. The failures are instructive — they reveal which parameters are truly structural (baseline grid, column width) and which are cosmetic (specific typeface, color). The rigid grid produces more visual variety, not less, because the constraints force creative solutions at the content level.
