## What It Is

Systemic music production. Engineering signal flow protocols applied to sonic composition and arrangement.

The question: can the same structural discipline that governs a database migration or a typographic grid produce coherent music? Not algorithmic composition — that's a different project. This is about applying signal flow thinking to the creative decisions in production: routing, gain staging, frequency allocation, dynamic range management.

## The Approach

Music production is a signal flow problem. Audio enters the system, passes through processing stages, and exits as a mix. Every stage has inputs, outputs, constraints, and failure modes. Most producers work intuitively through this chain. MathOnTape makes the signal flow explicit and systematic.

### Signal Architecture
Every session starts with a routing diagram. Not a mixer layout — a signal flow map showing how audio moves through the system, where processing happens, where decisions get made, and where the chain can break.

### Constraint-Driven Composition
Set the constraints before writing. Tempo, key, instrument palette, frequency allocation — these are design parameters, not creative choices made in the moment. The constraints create the space. The music fills it.

### Repeatable Process
Session templates. Gain staging protocols. Mix bus architecture documented before the first note plays. The goal isn't to remove creativity — it's to remove the administrative overhead that eats creative time. When the routing is handled, you can focus on the sound.

## What It Proves

Engineering discipline and creative expression aren't opposed. The signal flow protocols don't constrain the music — they create a stable structure that the music can push against. Same principle as every other system: constraints are the material, not the limitation.
