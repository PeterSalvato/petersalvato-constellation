## The Work

Systemic music production. Engineering signal flow protocols applied to sonic composition and arrangement.

The question: can the same structural discipline that governs a database migration or a typographic grid produce coherent music? Not algorithmic composition — that's a different project. This is about applying signal flow thinking to the creative decisions in production: routing, gain staging, frequency allocation, dynamic range management.

## The Approach

**Signal Architecture.** Every session starts with a routing diagram. Not a mixer layout — a signal flow map showing how audio moves through the system, where processing happens, where decisions get made, and where the chain can break.

**Constraint-Driven Composition.** Set the constraints before writing. Tempo, key, instrument palette, frequency allocation — these are design parameters, not creative choices made in the moment. The constraints create the space. The music fills it.

**Repeatable Process.** Session templates. Gain staging protocols. Mix bus architecture documented before the first note plays. The goal isn't to remove creativity — it's to remove the administrative overhead that eats creative time. When the routing is handled, you can focus on the sound.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Design parameters per session | 5+ (tempo, key, palette, frequency, dynamics) |
| Process components | 3 (signal architecture, constraint composition, repeatable process) |
| Session start | Routing diagram before first note |
| Signal chain | Documented inputs, outputs, and failure modes |
| Principle | Structure enables, doesn't constrain |

## What It Proves

Engineering discipline and creative expression aren't opposed. The signal flow protocols don't constrain the music — they create a stable structure that the music can push against. Same principle as every other system: constraints are the material, not the limitation.
