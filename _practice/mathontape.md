## Algorithmic Rhythm Research

Most musicians treat composition as intuition. But intuition breaks at scale. When you're building complex sonic architecture, you need structural thinking.

MathOnTape applies signal flow protocols to music production. Not to eliminate creativity. To amplify it. To make what works reproducible.

## The Method

Signal flow is how audio moves through space. How one module talks to another. How constraint shapes what can be heard. It's the engineering discipline underneath sonic architecture.

Apply signal flow thinking to composition and you reveal rhythm as algorithm. Sequence becomes structure. The music becomes buildable.

## The Proof

You can engineer sonic systems with the same discipline applied to narrative, design, and code. Protocol-driven composition produces structured, repeatable creative output.

Electronic music as applied systems thinking.
