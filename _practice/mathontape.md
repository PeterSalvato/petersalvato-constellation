## Algorithmic Rhythm Research

An electronic music project built on years of thinking systematically about sound, composition, and how rhythm works algorithmically. MathOnTape makes your thinking visible through sound. You can hear the structure.

Most musicians compose by feel. That works fine until the piece gets complex. Once you're building something intricate—layering sounds, managing how they interact, shaping what the listener hears—intuition alone isn't enough. You need to think like you're engineering something. Because you are.

## The Method

Think of how audio equipment works: each piece does one job, and pieces connect to each other in specific ways. This is signal flow—the path sound takes through the system. Apply that same thinking to composition: what comes first, what feeds into what, how does changing one thing ripple through everything else?

This isn't about killing creativity. It's the opposite. Constraints are what make things possible. Once you know the rules of how your pieces fit together, you can predict what will happen. You can repeat what works. You can build something bigger than you could before.

Each piece here shows how structure enables new possibilities. Rhythm becomes something you can design. Composition becomes something you can build. The visual language draws from mid-century electronic equipment—that old, purposeful aesthetic. Futuristic retro.

## The Proof

This is systems thinking applied to sound. Same discipline as Savepoint Protocol, but through music instead of narrative or code. Shows that the method works across different domains.

You can engineer electronic music with the same rigor you'd apply to anything else. Give yourself clear constraints. Follow the signal flow. Build it piece by piece. Structured thinking produces structured work—music that's repeatable, that makes sense, that you can actually explain.
