## Algorithmic Rhythm Research

Electronic music project applying engineering signal flow protocols to sonic composition. Visually branded audio-visual artifacts.

## The Narrative

Not "electronic music" but "Algorithmic Rhythm Research." Applying engineering signal flow to music production.

## The System

Engineering discipline applied to sonic composition. Protocol-driven approach to rhythm and sequencing.

## The Proof

You can engineer sonic systems just as you engineer narrative and design systems.
