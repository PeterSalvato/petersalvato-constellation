## Algorithmic Rhythm Research

An electronic music project proving years of systematic thinking about sound, composition, and algorithmic rhythm. MathOnTape is "explicit cognition"—making thinking observable through sound.

Most musicians treat composition as intuition. But intuition breaks at scale. When you're building complex sonic architecture, you need structural thinking. Signal flow is the engineering discipline underneath.

## The Method

Signal flow protocols applied to music production. Not to eliminate creativity—to amplify it. To make what works reproducible. Each composition demonstrates how constraint shapes what can be heard, how one module talks to another, how structure enables emergence.

Apply signal flow thinking to composition and you reveal rhythm as algorithm. Sequence becomes structure. The music becomes buildable. Mid-century gadget aesthetics inform the visual language—futuristic retro sensibility.

## The Proof

An ancestor to Savepoint Protocol thinking. Proof of systems-thinking practice applied across domains. The portfolio demonstrates intellectual depth and pedagogical sophistication—not just technical skill, but the ability to externalize thinking and make it structural.

You can engineer sonic systems with the same discipline applied to narrative, design, and code. Protocol-driven composition produces structured, repeatable creative output. Electronic music as applied systems thinking.
