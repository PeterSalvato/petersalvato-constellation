## Building With Constraints

Natural deodorant brand. Premium positioning demands a circular tin that resolves an impossible brief: everything signaling premium must coexist with everything the FDA mandates. Ingredients. Warnings. Allergens. Batch codes.

Most designers treat regulatory information like structural weakness—hide it, minimize it, push it to the margins. This project does the opposite. Regulations are load-bearing. Treat them as material.

## The Structural Problem

**Naming:** "Everyday Gold" had to be built to code. Registrable? No conflicts in cosmetics/deodorants? Checked. Class 3, clear. "Gold" is the metaphor—the gold standard of daily ritual, not a material claim.

**Logo:** The asterisk was reading as footnote notation. Wrong signal. Rebuilt as a geometric 4-point star: no acute angles, reads as "sparkle," structurally matched to the script's stroke weight.

**Label System:** Circular substrate. Three zones. Warm script logotype carries the top. Geometric monospaced type anchors product variants at center. The outer edge is the regulatory ring—all required information, 6pt, perfectly legible. Ingredients. Warnings. Batch codes. Certifications. Everything has a structural purpose.

## The Built Solution

A production-ready system. Not a design that hides legal requirements. A design where legal information sits in the visual hierarchy as structural skeleton. The regulations don't constrain the brand. They are the frame the brand is built on.

## Why Two Versions?

Everyday Gold exists in both Systems and Practice because it demonstrates label design under regulatory constraint, which is distinct from the operational infrastructure described in the systems version.

- **Practice version** (`/practice/everyday-gold`): This page. Label design and regulatory architecture. The answer to: "How do you encode regulatory requirements as design material?"

- **Systems version** (`/systems/everyday-gold`): Operational infrastructure. E-commerce logistics, inventory management, supply chain. The answer to: "How does a brand actually operate at scale?"

Both are necessary. The label proves the brand story. The operations prove the label isn't just design.
