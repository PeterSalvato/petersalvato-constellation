## Regulatory Fabrication

Brand identity and label design for a natural deodorant line focused on "accessible luxury."

## The Workshopping

Naming: Evaluated for trademark distinctiveness. Visual Critique: Iterated on asterisk/star element to read as integrated punctuation. Label Layout: Refined information hierarchy on circular tins for FDA compliance.

## The Implementation

FDA Information Hierarchy solved on circular substrate via constraint-driven architecture.

## The Result

Production-ready label system with finalized logo and signature placement.
