## Regulatory Fabrication

Brand identity and label design for a natural deodorant line focused on "accessible luxury."

## The Workshopping

Naming: Evaluated for trademark distinctiveness. Visual Critique: Iterated on asterisk/star element to read as integrated punctuation. Label Layout: Refined information hierarchy on circular tins for FDA compliance.

## The Implementation

FDA Information Hierarchy solved on circular substrate via constraint-driven architecture.

## The Result

Production-ready label system with finalized logo and signature placement.

## Why Two Versions?

Everyday Gold exists in both Systems and Practice because it demonstrates label design under regulatory constraint, which is distinct from the operational infrastructure described in the systems version.

- **Practice version** (`/practice/everyday-gold`): This page. Label design and regulatory architecture. The answer to: "How do you encode regulatory requirements as design material?"

- **Systems version** (`/systems/everyday-gold`): Operational infrastructure. E-commerce logistics, inventory management, supply chain. The answer to: "How does a brand actually operate at scale?"

Both are necessary. The label proves the brand story. The operations prove the label isn't just design.
