## Regulatory Fabrication

Natural deodorant brand. Premium positioning on a circular tin. The constraint: everything that says "premium" has to share space with everything FDA requires: ingredients list, warnings, allergen icons, batch codes.

Most designers hide regulatory information in fine print. This project treated it as structural material—first-class design content.

## The Challenge

**Naming:** "Everyday Gold." Is it registrable? Does it avoid conflicts in cosmetics/deodorants? Yes. It's registrable Class 3, no conflicts. "Gold" is metaphorical—gold-standard daily ritual, not an ingredient claim.

**Logo:** Original asterisk read as typographic notation—a footnote marker. Replaced with geometric 4-point star: eliminates acute angles, reads unmistakably as "sparkle," matches the script's stroke weight.

**Label:** Circular substrate with three zones. Warm script logotype (top). Geometric monospaced product name for scent variants (center). Regulatory ring (outer edge) carrying all required information at 6pt—ingredients, warnings, batch codes, certifications—positioned for legibility and compliance.

## The Result

Production-ready label system. Not a design hiding the legal stuff. A design where legal information is part of the visual hierarchy. The regulations become the skeleton the brand hangs on.

## Why Two Versions?

Everyday Gold exists in both Systems and Practice because it demonstrates label design under regulatory constraint, which is distinct from the operational infrastructure described in the systems version.

- **Practice version** (`/practice/everyday-gold`): This page. Label design and regulatory architecture. The answer to: "How do you encode regulatory requirements as design material?"

- **Systems version** (`/systems/everyday-gold`): Operational infrastructure. E-commerce logistics, inventory management, supply chain. The answer to: "How does a brand actually operate at scale?"

Both are necessary. The label proves the brand story. The operations prove the label isn't just design.
