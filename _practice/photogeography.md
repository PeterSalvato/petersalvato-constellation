## Somatic Evidence

Most photographers pretend to be objective. But the frame is a choice. The focal length is a choice. The moment you press the button is a choice.

Photogeography locks those choices. Three fixed aspect ratios. Format as honest evidence. Each photograph holds the shape it arrived in, without cropping or manipulation.

The constraint forces different seeing. When you can't crop, you have to compose differently. When you can't adjust the ratio, you have to position differently. The geography reveals itself through the frame you can't escape.

## The System

One location. Three locked ratios. Each photograph holds its original proportion exactly.

The geometry of the place emerges through format-driven perception. Not what you wanted to see. What the constraint forced you to notice.

## The Result

A visual archive that isn't trying to be pretty. Just present. Rigorous. The proof that fixed constraints generate emergence, not limitation.
