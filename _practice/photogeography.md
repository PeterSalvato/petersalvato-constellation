## The Work

A visual archive built on a simple premise: the shape of the image is part of the evidence.

Original conception: 35mm Minolta only, locked 3:2 aspect ratio. As the project evolved, the contradiction surfaced — the device mattered less than what was seen and felt. Forcing every image into 3:2 produced dishonest crops. Abandoning form-logic entirely broke the grid. The answer was a third option.

## The Principle

**Format-as-honest-evidence.** Each image is preserved in the shape it arrived — square, vertical, or wide. The aspect ratio isn't a stylistic choice. It's a record of how the image was met.

## The System

### Three Locked Formats

1. **3:2 landscape** — the original 35mm Minolta frame. Field recording. Observational evidence.
2. **4:3 landscape or vertical** — most modern phones. Moment of attention.
3. **1:1 square** — intentional crops. Internal notation. Moment of stillness.

### Container System

Each image sits in a framed container — standardized padding, consistent background tone, optional border stroke. Caption placement governed by format. The container holds the image the way a specimen tray holds a sample: with care, not decoration.

### Semantic Mapping

- **3:2**: "Field recording"
- **4:3**: "Observational frame"
- **1:1**: "Internal notation"

## What It Proves

Format variation is a feature, not a bug. The system prioritizes honest presentation over medium purity. Three locked ratios provide enough constraint to maintain grid coherence while respecting the way each image actually arrived.

## Technical Specifications

**Aspect Ratios** (locked): 3:2, 4:3, 1:1

**Source Devices**: 35mm Minolta film + modern smartphone (device-agnostic)

**Container System**: Framed specimen-tray format, standardized padding, background texture, optional border

**Visual Metaphors**: 3:2 = field recording, 4:3 = observational frame, 1:1 = internal notation

**Cohesion**: Color grading consistency, grid discipline, caption standardization
