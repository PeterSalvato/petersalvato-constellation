## Somatic Evidence

A constraint-based photography project about travels and the things you notice in places. Not about format fidelity or equipment specs. About the way you experience place. A record of perception: what you noticed, what lingered, what felt like it meant something.

Most photographers pretend to be objective. But every choice is loaded: the frame, the focal length, the moment you press the button. Photogeography locks those choices as honest evidence. Three fixed aspect ratios. Format as constraint, not limitation.

Each photograph holds the shape it arrived in, without cropping or manipulation. The constraint forces different seeing. When you can't crop, you have to compose differently. When you can't adjust the ratio, you have to position differently.

## The System

Three modular aspect ratios capture authentic perception:
- 3:2 landscape (35mm field recording)
- 4:3 landscape or vertical (phone observation)
- 1:1 square (intentional moment or native crop)

Each image placed in a framed container (like a specimen or pinned artifact) with fixed padding, subtle background tone, optional border. Standardized caption placement. Consistency through constraint, not cropping.

Color grading and tone remain consistent across formats. The geometry of the place emerges through format-driven perception—not what you wanted to see, but what the constraint forced you to notice.

## The Proof

"Photogeography respects the shape in which the image arrived. Because this isn't about the world—it's about how I met it."

A visual archive that isn't trying to be pretty. Just present. Rigorous. Proof that fixed constraints generate emergence, not limitation.
