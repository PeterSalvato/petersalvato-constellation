## The Work

A visual archive built on a simple premise: the shape of the image is part of the evidence.

Original conception: 35mm Minolta only, locked 3:2 aspect ratio. As the project evolved, the contradiction surfaced — the device mattered less than what was seen and felt. Forcing every image into 3:2 produced dishonest crops. Abandoning form-logic entirely broke the grid. The answer was a third option: format-as-honest-evidence.

## The Approach

**The Principle.** Each image is preserved in the shape it arrived — square, vertical, or wide. The aspect ratio isn't a stylistic choice. It's a record of how the image was met.

**Three Locked Formats.** 3:2 landscape (the original 35mm Minolta frame — field recording), 4:3 landscape or vertical (most modern phones — moment of attention), and 1:1 square (intentional crops — internal notation).

**Container System.** Each image sits in a framed container — standardized padding, consistent background tone, optional border stroke. Caption placement governed by format. The container holds the image the way a specimen tray holds a sample: with care, not decoration.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Locked aspect ratios | 3 (3:2, 4:3, 1:1) |
| Source devices | 35mm Minolta film + modern smartphone |
| Semantic mapping | 3:2 = field recording, 4:3 = observational frame, 1:1 = internal notation |
| Container format | Framed specimen-tray, standardized padding |
| Cohesion rules | Color grading consistency, grid discipline, caption standardization |

## What It Proves

Format variation is a feature, not a bug. The system prioritizes honest presentation over medium purity. Three locked ratios provide enough constraint to maintain grid coherence while respecting the way each image actually arrived.
