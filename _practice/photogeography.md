## The Format

Constraint-based photography. No cropping, no aspect ratio adjustment, no post-processing manipulation.

**The constraint:** Three locked aspect ratios (3:2, 4:3, 1:1). What you frame is what you get. The format becomes the teacher.

**The premise:** Photography pretends to neutrality. It isn't. Every crop, every adjustment is bias made aesthetic. What if you removed the photographer's ability to refine? What compositional decisions would shift to the moment of capture?

## What It Proves

**Constraint concentrates meaning.**

If you can't crop, you reposition. If you can't adjust aspect ratio, you learn to see in the shape the format demands. The constraint isn't a limitation—it's a clarifying force on seeing.

Same principle scales:
- Savepoint Protocol: Minimal syntax forces clarity
- New City: Cryptographic mechanics force revelation through action
- Order of the Aetherwright: Fixed roles force identity coherence

Removing degrees of freedom doesn't limit emergence—it generates it.

## The Thinking

<!--
Peter: Add your actual thinking here.
- What drew you to constraint-based photography?
- Specific moments where the constraint forced better seeing?
- Connection to how you think about design systems?
- Any specific images or sets that proved the concept?

## The Work

A visual archive with no interest in being beautiful. Somatic evidence. The actual record of how you met a place, in the shape it arrived, in the light that was actually there.
