## Somatic Evidence

Photography as geographic fingerprinting. A poster series treating a specific geography as raw data to extract its unique visual geometry.

Perception-driven visual archive using three locked aspect ratios.

## The System

One Location = One System. Three locked aspect ratios force visual thinking. Evolved from medium-constrained archive to perception-first system.

## The Proof

Rigid visual constraints generate a cohesive system. Constraint-driven visual forms hold under variable input.
