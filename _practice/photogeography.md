## Somatic Evidence

Photography pretends to neutrality. It isn't. Every decision carries weight: what you frame, the lens you choose, the split second you release. Photogeography documents these decisions as fact. Not beauty. Not technique. The actual record of how you encountered a place.

The constraint is the tool. Three fixed aspect ratios. You can't crop your way out—so you learn to see differently. Without the option to adjust proportions, you position differently. Without cropping, you compose differently. The format stops being invisible and becomes the thing that teaches you what to look for.

## The System

Three aspect ratios, fixed:
- 3:2 landscape (the 35mm field recording)
- 4:3 landscape or vertical (phone observation)
- 1:1 square (the intentional moment, the native crop)

Each image sits in a container. Frame, padding, background, optional border. Captions in standard place. Everything consistent because everything is constrained—not despite the constraint, but through it.

The tonal range stays steady across all formats. The geometry of a place reveals itself not through what you wanted to capture, but through what the format forced you to notice.

## The Proof

"Photogeography respects the shape in which the image arrived. Because this isn't about the world—it's about how I met it."

An archive that has no interest in being beautiful. Present. Rigorous. Fixed constraints don't limit emergence—they generate it.
