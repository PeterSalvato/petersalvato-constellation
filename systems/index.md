## Systems Under Pressure

Applied Systems are production deployments. The methodology either holds or fails. These held.

| System | What It Proves |
|--------|---------------|
| Encore | Enterprise scale (12 years, 40K users, 99.9% uptime) |
| Aiden-Jae | Brand positioning through technical architecture |
| Everyday Gold | Regulatory compliance as design material |
| Altrueism | Transparency through structural imperfection |
| Modernist Homestead | Domestic operations without willpower |

Same structural principles. Different constraints. Same result: systems that hold under load.
