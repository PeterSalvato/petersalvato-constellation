## Project Timeline Detail

### Week 1 (2026-02-10 to 2026-02-16): Setup & Analysis

#### Task 1.1: Establish Content Architecture
**Time:** 3-4 hours
**What:** Define the narrative structure for rebuilt case studies

**Approach:**
Each rebuilt case study will follow this structure:

```
1. OPENING STATEMENT
   - What problem was being solved?
   - Why did it matter?

2. THE THINKING (NEW)
   - Key constraints identified
   - Why certain approaches chosen
   - What was discovered in process

3. THE BUILDING (RECONSTRUCTED)
   - Technical/design/narrative decisions made
   - Why each decision (extraction sourced)
   - How constraints drove solutions

4. WHAT SURVIVED (FROM EXTRACTION)
   - What worked as expected
   - What needed to pivot
   - What the user actually needed vs assumed

5. THE SYSTEM (FINAL)
   - How all three systems work together
   - Narrative + Visual + Technical unified
   - Why this specific integration

6. THE LEARNING (PROCESS VISIBILITY)
   - What would you do differently
   - What principles held throughout
   - What this means for next projects
```

**Deliverable:** Content architecture template (applies to all 5 case studies)

---

#### Task 1.2: Mine Extraction for Key Moments
**Time:** 8-10 hours
**What:** Identify 3-5 critical decision moments per project from extraction

**Approach:**
For each of 5 projects:
1. Open project timeline file
2. Identify blocks that show:
   - Major pivots or direction changes
   - Constraint problems being solved
   - Why something was chosen over alternatives
   - Failure points and recovery
   - Cross-project connections
3. Extract verbatim passages (5-10 passages per project)
4. Note timestamps and conversation context

**Deliverable:** Extraction mining document with 25-50 key quotes per project

---

#### Task 1.3: Draft New Manifesto Statement
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**What:** Rewrite homepage manifesto to claim actual positioning

**Current manifesto (outcome-focused):**
> "I work at the intersection of classical design and full-stack engineering. The systems I build serve creative teams and neurodivergent founders who need structural support—not another SaaS dependency, but infrastructure they can own and operate."

**New manifesto (thinking-focused, extraction-grounded):**
Should explicitly:
- Claim "narrative infrastructure architect" positioning
- Show that thinking is visible/transparent
- Position extraction content as proof
- Maintain Master Builder voice (direct, concrete, no jargon)

**Deliverable:** Draft manifesto statement for review

**Tone check:** Does it pass the test: "Would you say this out loud to a peer you respect?"

---

## Detailed Work Instructions

### How to Rebuild a Case Study

**Step-by-step process for each of 5 projects:**

1. **Read current version**
   - Open file (e.g., `_systems/aiden-jae.md`)
   - Understand existing structure and narrative
   - Note what's currently emphasized

2. **Review extraction**
   - Open project timeline (e.g., `docs/extraction_timelines/aiden-jae-timeline.md`)
   - Read through blocks, identifying key decision moments
   - Highlight 3-5 "aha moments" where thinking becomes visible

3. **Extract key quotes**
   - For each key moment, copy verbatim passage from extraction
   - Preserve context (who said it, when, in what conversation)
   - Aim for 5-10 quotes per project

4. **Map to content architecture**
   - Using template from Task 1.1
   - Decide: which extraction content maps to which section?
   - Which thinking should be foregrounded?
   - Which decisions should be made visible?

5. **Write new case study**
   - Start with OPENING STATEMENT (what problem?)
   - Move to THE THINKING (why this approach?)
   - Section THE BUILDING (how built + extraction citations)
   - Section WHAT SURVIVED (process visibility)
   - Section THE SYSTEM (unified narrative+visual+technical)
   - Section THE LEARNING (what would you do differently?)

6. **Integrate extraction quotes**
   - Insert quotes where they illuminate thinking
   - Use block quotes for longer passages
   - Attribute clearly: [From Aiden Jae timeline, 2024-04-12]
   - Make sure quote flows naturally in narrative
   - Never force a quote just because you have it

7. **Voice check**
   - Read aloud (literally read it out loud)
   - Does it sound like you?
   - Would you say this to someone you respect?
   - Are there any moments where voice breaks?
   - Remove marketing language, jargon, aspirational tone

8. **Accuracy check**
   - Cross-reference every extraction quote with timeline file
   - Verify word-for-word match
   - Verify context isn't misrepresented
   - Check dates and conversation titles

9. **Length sanity check**
   - Current: ~100 lines, ~9K chars
   - Target: ~500 lines, ~40K chars
   - This is ~4-5x expansion
   - Expansion should be substantive (thinking + process), not padding

10. **Final review**
    - Read once more for flow
    - Check formatting (headers, code blocks, quotes)
    - Verify links work
    - Check frontmatter is correct
    - Ready to commit

## Extraction Content Guidelines

### What to Include From Extraction
- ✓ Thinking and rationale for decisions
- ✓ Failed experiments and pivots
- ✓ Constraint problems and solutions
- ✓ Why certain technical choices
- ✓ How narrative informed design/technical choices
- ✓ What would be done differently
- ✓ Cross-project connections and synthesis

### What NOT to Include
- ✗ Repetitive explanations of same concept
- ✗ Entire conversation transcripts (summarize instead)
- ✗ Personal asides unrelated to work
- ✗ Debugging logs or technical noise
- ✗ Placeholder thinking or early brainstorms
- ✗ Content that doesn't illuminate the work

### Citation Format
```markdown
> "Quoted text from extraction"
>
> — From [Project] timeline, [Date], [Platform] ([Conversation Title])
```

### Length Philosophy
- More content ≠ better content
- Every addition should add clarity or reveal thinking
- If a passage doesn't illuminate, cut it
- Aim for "generous" (40-50K chars per project), not "exhaustive"

## Who Does This Work

**For Extraction Content Mining & Case Study Rebuilding:**
- Claude AI (primary implementation)
- You (review, voice check, final approval)

**For Quality Assurance:**
- Voice protocol validation (against standards)
- Citation accuracy check (vs timeline files)
- Reading experience test (subjective judgment)
- Build validation (technical)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Voice Breaks in New Content
**Mitigation:** Every addition must pass "peer respect" test. Multiple voice checks.

### Risk: Extraction Quotes Feel Forced
**Mitigation:** Only include quotes that naturally illuminate. Better to have fewer, better quotes than many forced ones.

### Risk: Site Becomes Overwhelming
**Mitigation:** Generous expansion (4-5x) is controlled. All additional content is substantive. Phase 2 will add architecture to make content discoverable.

### Risk: Citations Become Inaccurate
**Mitigation:** 100% accuracy check against source timeline files. No paraphrasing of extraction content.

### Risk: Takes Longer Than 3-4 Weeks
**Mitigation:** Clear timeline with weekly checkpoints. Scope defined (5 projects only). Can extend if needed, but tracked explicitly.
