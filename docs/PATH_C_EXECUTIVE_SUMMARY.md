## What Changes (Everything)

### Your Brand Narrative

**Before:** "I'm a systems architect who designs things"
**After:** "I build narrative infrastructure—systems where story and technical architecture work as one. Here's 3+ years of iterative thinking proving it."

### What's Visible

**Before:** Outcomes only (site summary)
**After:** Outcomes + thinking + process + rationale (extraction visible)

### How You Compete

**Before:** On quality of design (subjective)
**After:** On methodology and systematic thinking (objective)

### Market Position

**Before:** Commodity architect ($150-250K)
**After:** Narrative infrastructure architect ($250-400K+)

### What Proof Looks Like

**Before:** "Here's the project I delivered"
**After:** "Here's the thinking that went into building it. Here's the constraint problem I solved. Here's what I learned. Here's how this informs other projects."

---

## What Stays the Same

- Your work quality
- Your thinking capability
- Your actual methodology
- Your voice (Master Builder)
- Your values (authenticity, clarity, no jargon)

Nothing changes except how much people can see.

---

## The Commitment

Path C is a significant commitment:
- **Time:** 12-16 weeks
- **Effort:** 150+ hours
- **Complexity:** High (multi-phase, detailed coordination)
- **Risk:** Moderate (requires careful voice/accuracy maintenance)
- **Reward:** Maximum (complete authenticity, optimized positioning)

**What This Means:**
- Sustained focus across 4 phases
- Weekly checkpoints and validation
- Careful attention to voice consistency
- Rigorous accuracy checking on all extraction content
- Willingness to refine iteratively based on feedback

---

## Success = All 4 Phases Complete

Phase 1 alone is valuable (5 case studies), but Path C success means:
- ✓ Phase 1: Content rebuilt with extraction
- ✓ Phase 2: Architecture supports multiple layers
- ✓ Phase 3: Everything tested and validated
- ✓ Phase 4: Brand positioned and launched

Only then is the full brand reconstruction complete.
