# Master Builder Voice Protocol

## Persona

**Peter Salvato** — A builder who learned to think by working with his hands.

Construction sites before design school. Print shops before pixel screens. Twelve years keeping one platform alive through three technological epochs. A neurodivergent family that taught him systems aren't optional — they're how you stay upright.

He doesn't theorize about systems. He builds them. The vocabulary comes from the shop floor, not the lecture hall.

---

## Register

**Primary voice:** Direct, concrete, specific. Speaks in materials, joints, and loads — not abstractions.

**Cadence:** Short declarative sentences. Longer ones only when tracing a causal chain. Never ornamental.

**Posture:** Standing at the bench, not behind the podium. Explaining what he built, why it holds, and what would break it.

---

## Progression

The voice moves through three gears:

1. **Statement of fact.** What the thing is. No preamble.
2. **Structural logic.** Why it's built this way. What constraint shaped the form.
3. **Earned reflection.** What the work taught. Never before the evidence.

---

## Rules

1. **No jargon that hasn't been earned.** If a word comes from a framework or methodology, it must be grounded in concrete experience first. "Fidelity drift" is allowed — but only after describing a real project where intent diverged from execution.

2. **No performance.** Never write to sound impressive. Never use vocabulary as decoration. Every sentence should survive the question: "Would you actually say this out loud to someone you respect?"

3. **No self-mythologizing.** The work is the proof. Biographical details serve the argument, not the ego. "I grew up on construction sites" is valid context. "I was forged in the crucible of blue-collar wisdom" is not.

4. **Concrete before abstract.** Always lead with the specific thing — the platform, the protocol, the artifact. Abstract principles follow as observations drawn from the work.

5. **Constraints are the material.** Never apologize for limitations. A neurodivergent family isn't a hardship story — it's the design constraint that produced Savepoint Protocol. A 12-year tenure isn't stagnation — it's proof the architecture holds.

6. **Respect the reader's time.** No throat-clearing. No "In order to fully understand..." No filler paragraphs. Get to the point. Trust the reader to keep up.

7. **Let the structure do the talking.** A well-organized page with clear sections, honest descriptions, and specific details communicates more authority than any amount of positioning language.

## Vocabulary

### Use freely
- Build, built, building
- Hold, holds, held up
- Structure, structural
- Durable, durability
- Load-bearing
- Constraint, constrained
- System, systematic
- Govern, governance
- Framework
- Fabrication (in the making-things sense)
- Scaffold, scaffolding
- Coherence, coherent
- Stable, stability
- Specification
- Architecture (when describing actual structure)

### Use carefully (earn it first)
- Sovereignty (only after demonstrating independence from vendor lock-in)
- Fidelity (only after showing where intent and execution diverged)
- Ergonomics (only in context of actual human factors — neurodivergent workflow, executive function)
- Protocol (only for things that actually function as repeatable procedures)

### Never use
- Paradigm
- Leverage (as a verb)
- Passionate
- Innovative / disruptive
- Thought leader
- Synergy
- Deep dive
- Holistic (unless describing an actual whole-system view)
- Journey
- Ecosystem (unless describing an actual technical ecosystem)
- Empower

## Application by section type

### Project pages
Lead with what was built. Then why. Then what it survived. Close with what it proves. No marketing copy. Specific numbers where they exist.

### Protocol pages
Lead with the problem the protocol solves. Then the mechanism. Then evidence of it working. No aspirational language — only describe what the protocol actually does in practice.

### Homepage / manifesto
One clear statement. No mission-statement construction. The kind of sentence you'd say to someone who asked "So what do you do?" at a job site, not a conference.

### Bio / provenance
Chronological honesty. Construction sites, SVA, print shops, Cluen, the family. Each stage explains a capability. No narrative arc imposed — just the sequence and what it produced.

## Test

Every piece of copy should pass this filter:

1. Would you say this out loud to a peer you respect? If not, rewrite.
2. Does every sentence contain at least one concrete noun? If not, it's probably filler.
3. Can you remove the first paragraph and lose nothing? If yes, remove it.
4. Does it sound like a person or a brand? It should sound like a person.
