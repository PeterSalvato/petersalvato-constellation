# Content Architecture Template for Rebuilt Case Studies

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Applies To:** Savepoint Protocol, Modernist Homestead, Aiden Jae, New City, Order of the Aetherwright

---

## Overview

This template defines the narrative structure for all five rebuilt case studies. Each project will follow this six-section architecture, with decisions documented about what visibility each section provides into thinking, constraints, and process.

The structure moves from **problem → thinking → building → validation → integration → learning**, making visible not just *what* was built, but *why* it was built that way and what the work teaches.

---

## The Six-Section Structure

### 1. OPENING STATEMENT
**Purpose:** Establish the problem and why it mattered.

**What Goes Here:**
- The specific constraint or problem being solved (concrete, not abstract)
- Why this problem was worth solving
- The scope of the challenge
- What success would look like
- Who faced this problem (or what system needed fixing)

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Positioning language or marketing copy
- The solution itself (save for later sections)
- How the solution works (technical details belong in Section 3)
- Personal reflections or lessons (those go in Section 6)

**Word Count Target:** 200-400 words (short and focused)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Direct quotes defining the problem
- Statements about constraints or requirements
- Context about why the work mattered
- Descriptions of the initial challenge

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "Savepoint Protocol emerged from a specific cognitive constraint: maintaining clarity across multiple complex projects while experiencing executive dysfunction. The problem wasn't note-taking—it was something deeper. Existing tools captured *what* happened, but not *why* decisions were made or how thinking shifted. Recovery required not just access to past work, but access to the transformation moments within that work."

---

### 2. THE THINKING
**Purpose:** Make visible the decision-making process and constraints that shaped approach.

**What Goes Here:**
- Key constraints identified early
- Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- Mental models or frameworks applied
- Questions that drove the work forward
- Assumptions that were tested or challenged
- How the problem was reframed during development

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Implementation details (those belong in Section 3)
- Results or validation (belongs in Section 4)
- Code, technical specifications, or mechanics (Section 3)
- Completed system description (Section 5)
- Lessons learned (Section 6)

**Word Count Target:** 400-600 words (this section should be generous—thinking visibility is core)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Quotes about why certain approaches chosen over others
- Passages exploring alternative solutions and why they didn't work
- Statements about constraints driving design
- Dialogue about shifting understanding
- Reasoning about trade-offs

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "The key insight was that transformation, not documentation, was the real need. Most note systems assume memory is the bottleneck—capture more, organize better, search faster. But for neurodivergent cognition, the bottleneck is *coherence*. How do you hold a complex idea steady across days, weeks, even months of context shifts? The protocol needed to capture not the facts, but the skeleton of thinking that held those facts together."

---

### 3. THE BUILDING
**Purpose:** Show how the thinking translated into actual structure—technical, visual, and narrative.

**What Goes Here:**
- Major decisions made during construction
- How constraints shaped specific solutions
- Why certain technical/design choices over alternatives
- What was built vs. what was initially imagined
- Pivots that emerged during building
- Failed experiments or approaches that were abandoned
- How narrative, visual, and technical systems interacted

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Generic implementation tutorials (only decisions specific to this project)
- Marketing descriptions of features
- Everything works as planned (show struggles and refinements)
- User documentation (belongs elsewhere)
- Reflections on what it all means (Section 6)

**Word Count Target:** 600-900 words (detailed, with extraction citations)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Quotes explaining *why* specific technical choices were made
- Passages about problems encountered and solved
- Discussions of failed approaches
- Reasoning about trade-offs between options
- Moments where thinking had to shift based on building constraints

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "The first attempt stored all data in a single hierarchical structure. The assumption was that organizing by date + category would make retrieval obvious. Within two weeks, the system became unusable. Queries required three or four branches of navigation, and the moment you moved outside the exact category you filed something under, it became invisible. The rebuild introduced a radial index system—multiple entry points converging on the same block, allowing you to approach it from thinking-paths, not filing-paths."

---

### 4. WHAT SURVIVED
**Purpose:** Test thinking against reality—show what held up and what required refinement.

**What Goes Here:**
- What worked as expected (and why it worked)
- What had to be refined or completely changed
- How users (or constraints) revealed different needs than expected
- Failures that became insights
- Principles that held throughout the work
- Where intent and execution diverged—and why
- Evidence that the structure actually solves the problem

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Features that never existed (only things that were actually built and tested)
- Speculation about what might work (only what demonstrated it works)
- Generic success metrics (specific evidence only)
- Technical implementation details (save for Section 3 if not already there)
- Lessons or implications (belong in Section 6)

**Word Count Target:** 300-500 words (concise validation)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Quotes about testing or validation
- Passages about unexpected discoveries
- Discussion of how the system actually performs
- Moments where theory met practice
- User feedback or lived experience

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "The radial index held. Six months of use proved the architecture survived the constraint it was built for—across 40+ active projects, retrieval remained fast and intuitive. What didn't survive: the assumption that tagging could be lightweight. Users naturally created a vocabulary that needed careful maintenance. What surprised us: the system became useful for collaborative work in ways we hadn't designed for. Groups using it developed shared patterns for marking decision points, creating emergent structure we couldn't have prescribed."

---

### 5. THE SYSTEM
**Purpose:** Show how narrative, visual, and technical work together as a unified whole.

**What Goes Here:**
- How the three domains (narrative, visual, technical) serve the same problem
- Why a specific integration approach vs. alternatives
- How each domain reinforces the others
- Where they create tension and how that tension was resolved
- Evidence that integration actually improves the whole
- How understanding in one domain affected choices in others

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Detailed explanation of how to build this system (use Section 3)
- How to use it (documentation, not case study)
- Positions this takes on larger design philosophy (might go in Section 2)
- Lessons or future implications (Section 6)

**Word Count Target:** 300-400 words (focused on integration, not breadth)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Quotes about how domains informed each other
- Passages explaining the unified strategy
- Discussions of technical-narrative integration
- Reasoning about why integration matters
- Cross-domain thinking moments

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "The visual structure mirrors the cognitive model. Each transformation is marked not with text, but with a threshold symbol—visual fidelity that makes navigation intuitive. The technical layer (search, access, versioning) enables the narrative layer to be readable and temporal without becoming cluttered. The narrative layer (which transformation? what shifted?) gives the technical system purpose. Remove any layer, and the other two collapse. This isn't ornamental integration—it's structural: each domain makes the others possible."

---

### 6. THE LEARNING
**Purpose:** Document what the work taught, for both this project and others.

**What Goes Here:**
- What would be done differently if starting over
- Principles that held across all five projects (if applicable)
- Specific insights about constraint-solving
- How this work informs the next work
- What the methodology reveals about the larger problem
- Generative questions raised by the work
- Cross-project connections or synthesis

**What Does NOT Go Here:**
- Generic "lessons" without specificity
- Aspirational language about what *should* be true
- Positioning or marketing implications
- Personal stories unrelated to the work
- Speculation beyond what evidence supports

**Word Count Target:** 300-500 words (reflective but grounded)

**Extraction Content Suitable For This Section:**
- Quotes about what was learned
- Passages reflecting on process
- Discussions of principles that emerged
- Statements about applying learning to future work
- Cross-project insights

**What Good Looks Like:**
> "One principle emerged across all five projects: constraint is not the enemy of coherence, it's the foundation. Every system that held together did so because we honored the specific constraint it was built under. Every system that became unwieldy or incoherent did so because we tried to build 'flexibility' that violated the original constraint. For future work: start by asking not 'What might we want?' but 'What is the actual edge we're defending against?' The system that answers that question will survive. Everything else is ornament."

## How to Use This Template

### For Each of the Five Projects:

1. **Read the current case study** — Understand existing narrative and what's already emphasized
2. **Review the extraction timeline** — Identify 5-10 substantive quotes that illuminate thinking
3. **Map quotes to sections** — Each quote maps to one of the six sections above
4. **Write following the structure** — Start with Opening Statement, move through sequentially
5. **Voice check** — Every sentence should pass: "Would I say this to a peer I respect?"
6. **Accuracy check** — Verify every extraction quote is verbatim to source
7. **Length sanity check** — Total should be 2,400-3,700 words (roughly 4-5x the original)

### Applying to All Five Projects:

This structure works because it's **problem-driven**, not **solution-driven**. Each project:
- Started with a specific constraint (Opening Statement)
- Required thinking through alternatives (The Thinking)
- Demanded technical/visual/narrative decisions (The Building)
- Had to prove it actually solves the constraint (What Survived)
- Unified multiple domains toward one goal (The System)
- Revealed principles applicable elsewhere (The Learning)

The proportions may shift (some projects need more "thinking," others more "building"), but the skeleton stays consistent.

---

## Why This Structure Works

### 1. **Problem-First Framing**
Each case study begins by establishing *what constraint you're actually solving*, not what you built. This immediately separates positioning from honesty. Readers understand the real challenge before seeing the solution.

### 2. **Thinking Made Visible**
Section 2 is expansive because decision-making is the real artifact. Technical implementation is replaceable; the thinking that shaped it is what proves mastery. Making it visible claims authority.

### 3. **Process Visibility**
Section 3 shows struggle, failed experiments, and refinement. This is more credible than perfection. Professionals trust builders who show their work.

### 4. **Validation, Not Sales**
Section 4 proves the system actually works by showing what survived reality. Not promises, but evidence. This is the opposite of marketing language.

### 5. **Integration Matters**
Section 5 claims that narrative, visual, and technical work together. This positions you as someone who thinks in systems, not disciplines.

### 6. **Scalable Thinking**
Section 6 extracts principles that apply beyond one project. This suggests you're building toward something coherent, not just solving isolated problems.

## Decisions Made in This Template

### Question 1: Does this structure work?
**Decision: YES, with modifications from the proposal.**

The original six sections were sound, but we've reweighted emphasis:
- **More** time on thinking and decision-making (Section 2 is generous)
- **More** time on failed experiments and refinement (Section 3 and 4 show struggle)
- **Less** time on final state (Section 5 is integration-focused, not exhaustive description)
- **More** time on learning that applies to other work (Section 6 looks outward)

### Question 2: Emphasis on thinking vs. outcomes?
**Decision: 60/40 thinking-forward.**

- Opening establishes the problem (thinking required)
- The Thinking section is the largest (thinking visible)
- The Building shows thinking translated to practice (thinking + implementation)
- What Survived validates thinking (thinking tested)
- The System explains unified thinking (thinking integrated)
- Learning extracts thinking that scales (thinking generalized)

Outcomes are present (you built something), but thinking is foregrounded. This matches Master Builder positioning: authority comes from showing *why*, not just *what*.

### Question 3: Failed experiments vs. successes?
**Decision: Equal weight.**

The template explicitly calls for showing:
- Approaches abandoned (Section 3)
- Refinements required (Section 4)
- Failures that became insights (Section 4)
- Principles that held despite challenges (Section 6)

This reflects reality: complex systems don't spring perfect. Showing the work proves mastery. Marketing hides struggle; credibility shows it.

## Example Quote Mapping

To show how quotes map to sections, here's a sample project with hypothetical quotes:

**Savepoint Protocol — Thinking Moment:**
- **Date:** 2024-10-15
- **Maps To:** Section 2 (The Thinking)
- **Quote:** "The key insight was that transformation, not documentation, was the real need. Most note systems assume memory is the bottleneck. But for neurodivergent cognition, the bottleneck is coherence. How do you hold a complex idea steady across days of context shifts? The protocol needed to capture the skeleton of thinking that holds facts together."
- **Why It Matters:** Shows the reframing that drove design decisions (cognitive constraint, not technical constraint)

**Savepoint Protocol — Building Decision:**
- **Date:** 2024-11-02
- **Maps To:** Section 3 (The Building)
- **Quote:** "The first attempt stored everything hierarchically by date + category. Within two weeks it was unusable. Queries required four branches of navigation, and moving outside the exact category made things invisible. We rebuilt with a radial index—multiple entry points converging on the same block. You could approach it from thinking-paths, not filing-paths."
- **Why It Matters:** Shows technical decision driven by lived constraint (not theory), and willingness to abandon initial approach

## Applying Across All Five Projects

### Savepoint Protocol
- **Primary Focus:** Cognitive architecture, transformation capture, neurodivergent systems thinking
- **Key Constraint:** Executive dysfunction + need for coherence across complexity
- **Unique Sections:** The Thinking and The System will be particularly substantive

### Modernist Homestead
- **Primary Focus:** Physical space as cognitive prosthetic, neurodivergent family systems
- **Key Constraint:** Designing for executive function, emotional regulation, sensory needs
- **Unique Sections:** The Building and What Survived will show environmental design decisions

### Aiden Jae
- **Primary Focus:** Luxury brand narrative + technical infrastructure + visual coherence
- **Key Constraint:** Making "accessible luxury" coherent across all touchpoints
- **Unique Sections:** The System and The Learning will explore brand integration

### New City
- **Primary Focus:** Worldbuilding systems, narrative + game mechanics + cryptography
- **Key Constraint:** Complexity of narrative integration with technical systems
- **Unique Sections:** The Building will be comprehensive; The System will show narrative-technical unity

### Order of the Aetherwright
- **Primary Focus:** Framework development, symbolic systems, cross-domain application
- **Key Constraint:** Maintaining coherence across multiple application contexts
- **Unique Sections:** The Learning will be extensive; the framework's principles will clearly apply elsewhere

Each project will follow the same six-section structure, but emphasis and examples will be customized to what each project actually reveals.

## Final Note

This template is reusable and should be clear enough that someone could rebuild a case study using only this guide. It prioritizes *clarity of thinking* over breadth of content. A well-executed case study following this structure will demonstrate:

1. You understand the actual constraint being solved (not just symptoms)
2. You think through alternatives (not just apply templates)
3. You show your work (failed experiments visible, not hidden)
4. You integrate multiple domains toward one goal (systems thinking)
5. You extract principles that scale (generative thinking)

That's credibility. That's what positions as a narrative infrastructure architect, not just a builder of individual projects.
