# Savepoint Protocol

I built a markup language to capture where thinking shifts. Not to document what I decided—to mark the moment when I *realized* something.

The constraint was concrete and brutal: executive dysfunction meeting distributed work. I'd start a conversation about moving. It would branch into help with a PHP portfolio site, then a game idea, then a novel writing question, then a cyberdeck design, then gluten-free baking expertise, then personal style, then back to the site. Each conversation was real work. Each mattered. Each built on previous thinking.

But here's what broke: the thinking didn't live anywhere. I'd have a realization in conversation three that directly contradicted what I'd said in conversation seven, but I had no way to see that until I was already deep in the wrong direction again. The decision tree existed only in the conversation history. The *thinking evolution*—the moments where I realized something was wrong and changed course—those were invisible. Buried in chat logs across three different platforms.

The real friction showed up when I needed to retrace my steps. Not the steps themselves. The *thinking*. When did I realize the mouse guard system wasn't the right model? Where did I figure out that a markup language was what I actually needed? Those moments didn't exist in any retrievable form. I had the output. I had no record of the inflection points.

Every project had this problem. A chore sheet built on dice mechanics. A portfolio site that needed architecture decisions. A novel that had to preserve my voice. A cyberdeck for disaster prep. A personal style framework. A game architecture. Each one had moments where the approach shifted. Each one had realizations that changed everything. And I was losing them.

What emerged was a protocol. Not a database. Not a management system. A way to mark, inline, where thinking shifted. A savepoint isn't after you make the decision. It's *at* the moment you realize the previous direction was wrong. It captures the inflection point.

The protocol evolved through forty-seven different refinements. Each one tested against actual work. The early versions were too verbose. They tried to capture too much. Then they were too sparse. They lost the context. The tension was between fidelity and usability. Between capturing enough to retrace the thinking and staying lightweight enough that marking a savepoint didn't interrupt the work.

What proved it worked: I could pull up an old project and retrace not just what I'd decided, but *why*. I could see where I'd pivoted. I could understand why version three had failed and version seven had held. The savepoints created a record of cognitive architecture that didn't exist before.

The marker landed in the markup between the moment before realization and the moment after. Not explanation. Not justification. The literal inflection point. When you mark it correctly, you can read the whole arc of thinking from that spot. You see what was questioned. You see what shifted. You see what held.

Validation came from being able to return to projects six months later with full cognitive reconstruction. Not summary. Not notes. The actual thinking path, visible and followable. That proves the protocol works: it survives the test of whether you can actually retrace your own mind.

The constraint it solved wasn't organizational. It was cognitive. How do you build a system that holds the *shape* of your thinking, not just the output? How do you make visible the moments when a pattern breaks and you change course? Those moments are where craft lives. The protocol makes them retrievable.
