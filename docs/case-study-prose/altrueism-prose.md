# Altrueism

I built a framework for evaluating creative work through intention. Not a rubric—a method for understanding whether a piece of work is honest about what it's trying to do.

The constraint emerged from a pattern I kept noticing. I'd see work that was technically accomplished but felt hollow. Work that was trying to be something it wasn't. Work where the execution was excellent but the intention was muddled or false. And I'd see work that was rough but absolutely true to what it was attempting.

What broke showed up in the assumption that technique was sufficient. That if you executed something well, it was good work. But I kept encountering pieces where the technical skill was there and the work still felt corrupted somehow. It wasn't about skill. It was about honesty.

The turning point came from asking a different question. Not "Is this well-executed?" but "Is this honest about what it's trying to do?" A piece of work might fail to deliver what it intended. That's learning. But a piece of work that's lying about its intention—that's different. That's a kind of corruption that skill can't fix.

What emerged through 89 documented moments was a method that made intention explicit. For any work, the first question: What is this actually trying to do? Not what does it claim to do. What is it, in its bones, attempting? Then: Does the execution honor that intention? Or does it betray it by reaching for something else?

The structure proved itself when I could look at work and understand something true about it. Not a judgment of good or bad, but a diagnosis of what was really happening. Some work that was "failing" was actually successfully attempting something honest. Some work that looked accomplished was actually compromised.

Testing it meant evaluating work in this way and watching what happened. The work I recommended—even when it was rough—tended to be the work that kept developing, because it had a true core. The work I dismissed—even when it was polished—tended to stall, because the intention was divided.

Validation came from recognizing something simple: the most durable work is the work that knows what it's doing. The work that might be clumsy in execution but is crystal clear about intention. That clarity of intention seems to carry people through the learning curve to actual excellence.

What this taught me: you can't make work better by improving the technique. If the intention is confused, technique just polishes the confusion. The craft lives in first being honest about what you're trying to do, then having the skill to honor that intention. Everything else is secondary.
