# The Deep Cuts

I built a methodology for learning from failure points. Not post-mortems—a systematic way to isolate and understand the specific moments when and why something didn't work.

The constraint was both practical and painful. I'd create work I was proud of, and sometimes it would fail. The client would reject it. The audience wouldn't connect. The technique wouldn't deliver. And I'd have no clear way to understand why. I'd have the artifact. I'd have the outcome. But I had no access to the actual failure point—where the thinking was wrong or where the execution missed.

What broke showed up in the pattern of repeated mistakes. I'd solve a problem one way, move on, then encounter the same problem again and solve it the same wrong way. The learning wasn't happening because I had no way to extract what actually went wrong from the failure. I was treating failure as undifferentiated—just "it didn't work."

The turning point came from recognizing that failure is actually specific. This aspect failed for this reason in this moment. That aspect failed for a completely different reason. Most failures are composite. They have multiple failure points. And each one teaches something different if you can isolate it.

What emerged through 67 documented moments was a method that treated failure as raw material for thinking. Not as shame to be overcome, but as information to be processed. For each failure, the questions were precise: What assumption was wrong? Where did execution diverge from intention? What constraint was I missing? What was I not seeing?

The structure proved itself when the same failure stopped recurring. When I could encounter a similar situation and recognize the pattern before committing to the same wrong direction. When the learning actually transferred to new contexts.

Testing it meant sitting with failures long enough to really understand them. Working through the discomfort of admitting that something I'd made wasn't good enough. Following the failure back to its actual root cause, not just the surface symptom.

Validation came from watching patterns shift. The same categories of failure would appear less frequently. New categories would emerge—which meant I was encountering new territory, which meant I was actually pushing into growth rather than repeating the same plateau. The work improved not because I got better at succeeding, but because I got better at failing usefully.

What this taught me: failure is only wasted if you don't learn from it. Most people avoid looking at their failures too closely. The craft lives in the exact opposite instinct—in being willing to sit with failure, to examine it systematically, to extract what it's teaching you. The failures that hurt the most often teach the most.
