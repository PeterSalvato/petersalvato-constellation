# Versagrams

I built a format for expressing linguistic transformation. A system for showing that words don't have single meanings—they contain multitudes.

The constraint was philosophical and practical. Words are supposed to mean one thing. That's how language is supposed to work. But in reality, words transform depending on context, on who's using them, on what they're trying to do. We force them into single meanings through written language. In doing that, we lose something true about how language actually works.

What broke showed up in the inadequacy of linear writing. I'd try to express an idea and realize the same word meant something different in different contexts. I'd write "the word X contains these meanings" and in doing so, I'd linearize something that's actually multidimensional. I'd kill the living quality of the language to make it fit the page.

The turning point came from recognizing that the constraint wasn't the words. The constraint was the format. What if I built a format that didn't force resolution? That could show transformation without collapsing it into single meaning? That could let a word contain multiple, even contradictory, senses without forcing choice?

What emerged through 9 documented moments was a simple format: versagrams. A word with multiple versions, each showing a different facet of meaning, a different context of use. Not definitions exactly. Variations. Transformations. The word living across multiple registers simultaneously.

The structure proved itself when the format could capture what linear writing couldn't. When a word could be understood as containing multitudes. When the transformation itself became visible as the actual subject, not something to apologize for in language.

Testing it meant using the format. Could it express what I meant? Could someone else read it and understand not just the words but the multidimensionality of the concept? Did the format preserve the life of the language or kill it? The answers were clear: the format honored what language actually is. It worked because it refused to force simplification.

Validation came from recognizing something simple: language is always more complex than our writing systems admit. Versagrams work because they acknowledge that. They say: here's a word. Here's what it does. Here are the different contexts it transforms through. Here's the pattern. Not resolution. Not definition. Recognition.

What this taught me: the most powerful language isn't the most precise. It's the most honest about multiplicity. The format works because it stops trying to force words into single meanings. It shows the word as it actually is—alive, transforming, containing contradictions. The craft lives not in simplifying language but in letting language be what it actually is.
