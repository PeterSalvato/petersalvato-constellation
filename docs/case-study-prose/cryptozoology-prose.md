# Cryptozoology

I built a research system for capturing pattern across fragmented sources. Not a database—a method for noticing what connects when information is scattered and sources are contradictory.

The constraint was epistemological. When you're trying to understand something that's not well-documented or widely accepted, you can't use standard research methods. You have rumor. Anecdote. Misremembered accounts. Photographs that might be genuine or might be hoaxes. How do you think about evidence when you can't demand certainty?

What broke showed up in the attempt to force certainty where it doesn't exist. If I demanded that sources be reliable, I'd have almost nothing to work with. If I accepted everything uncritically, I'd be lost in noise. The pattern I was after wasn't "provably true." It was "visible across multiple independent sources, even when those sources contradict each other."

The turning point came from recognizing that uncertainty is a feature, not a bug. What if I tracked not just what people claimed, but patterns in what they disagreed about? Disagreement often reveals as much as agreement. Where do the versions diverge? What do they agree on even when they disagree on details?

What emerged through 53 documented moments was a methodology that treated fragmented and contradictory sources as data. Not "is this true?" but "what's this telling me?" The pattern emerges not from any single source being reliable, but from multiple unreliable sources pointing in the same direction, or disagreeing in consistent ways.

The structure proved itself when patterns became visible that you couldn't see in any single source. When the noise resolved into signal. When you could say something true about the subject even though no individual piece of evidence was conclusive.

Testing it meant following the method on small questions where you could verify the answer. Did the system's conclusions match what you learned from other means? It did. The method worked not because it guaranteed certainty, but because it was honest about how certainty actually works when sources are fragmented.

Validation came from recognizing something real: most of the things that matter are known from fragmentary evidence. History. Science. Personal narrative. We're always working from incomplete sources. The method just made that process explicit instead of pretending certainty we don't have.

What this taught me: knowledge isn't binary. You don't have "true" or "false." You have probabilities, patterns, and convergence. The craft lives in being sophisticated about uncertainty. In knowing how to think clearly when you don't have definitive evidence. In trusting pattern more than you trust any single source.
