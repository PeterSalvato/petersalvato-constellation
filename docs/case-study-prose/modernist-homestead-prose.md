# Modernist Homestead

I built a kitchen system that held multiple constraints simultaneously. Not just recipes—a framework that could navigate celiac restrictions, modernist cooking technique, dietary strategy, and family logistics without losing the coherence of any one of them.

The constraint started concrete: I wanted to move. I needed to figure out how. But the real friction emerged quickly. Moving isn't just about space. It's about how you live in space. I cook. I have a family with celiac disease. I have preferences for modernist technique. I wanted a kitchen that could hold all of that without forcing compromise.

What broke showed up in the kitchen. I'd plan a meal thinking only about the celiac constraint. Then it wouldn't work for the modernist technique I wanted to use. Or it would work technically but feel fragmented and unsafe. The problem wasn't any single constraint—it was that they didn't talk to each other. I'd reference a decision I'd made weeks earlier about what ingredients work for celiac adaptation, but I couldn't remember the reasoning. I'd start building a recipe and realize halfway through that I'd already committed to an incompatible technique in a different planning conversation.

The turning point was recognizing this wasn't just a moving problem. It was an information architecture problem. The kitchen doesn't care about your categorization system. It cares about what actually happens when you cook. I was planning as if constraints were separate. They're not. When you're cooking modernist techniques with celiac restrictions, the constraints are inseparable.

What emerged through 211 documented moments across nearly two years was a system that didn't isolate the constraints. It held them as a unified field. The recipe app I built wasn't about storing recipes. It was about creating a space where every decision about an ingredient or technique had to account for all the constraints simultaneously.

The structure evolved through phases of refinement. Early on, I tried to build separate systems. A recipe database. A shopping system. A meal plan. But they kept fracturing. The real work wasn't in separation—it was in binding. The system had to make visible when choices in one domain affected choices in another.

Testing it meant cooking through it. When I could execute a meal plan and feel like every decision was coherent—the technique was right, the adaptation was safe, the family could eat it, the ingredients were available—that's when I knew the architecture held. The validation wasn't theoretical. It was in the actual food.

What this taught me: systems that serve physical reality can't use abstract categories. A kitchen is not an information problem. It's a coordination problem. You're holding time, safety, preference, technique, and budget all at once. The framework has to acknowledge that all those things are present, simultaneously, in every decision. The strength of the system is not in how cleanly it separates concerns. It's in how honestly it shows that concerns can't be separated.

The Modernist Homestead works because it refuses to simplify what's actually complex. That's where the craft lives—in the acceptance of the full shape of the problem.
