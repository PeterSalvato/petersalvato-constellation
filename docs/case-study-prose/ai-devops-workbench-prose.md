# AI DevOps Workbench

I built an archive system to hold thinking across multiple AI conversations. Not a note-taking app—a method for maintaining continuous context when tools reset and sessions end.

The constraint was immediate and frustrating. I work across Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Each conversation, the context resets. I'd build up understanding with one tool, then start a new session and lose everything. I'd ask the same clarifying questions again. I'd re-establish the same context. The work felt fragmented, repetitive, and I kept losing momentum.

What broke showed up in the cognitive load. Each new session meant reconstructing everything from scratch. What had we discussed? What had we agreed on? What decisions had I made based on previous work? I had artifacts from the conversations, but I had no continuous narrative of thinking. The sessions felt like isolated islands instead of a developing coastline.

The turning point came from recognizing that the constraint wasn't the tools. It was the discontinuity. What if I built something that could bridge sessions? That could maintain context across the breaks? That could give each new session enough understanding to continue where the previous one ended?

What emerged through 42 documented moments was a system that treated each session's output as input to the next session. Not just the artifacts—the actual thinking. What had we figured out? What problems had we solved? What were we stuck on? The system captured that narrative and made it retrievable.

The structure proved itself when I could start a new session and have immediate context. When I didn't have to re-explain what I was doing. When the conversation could continue from genuine progress instead of starting from zero. When the work actually accelerated because I wasn't losing momentum at session boundaries.

Testing it meant using the system on real work. Did it maintain continuity? Did new sessions feel like continuations or restarts? The answer was clear: the system bridged the gap. Progress compound. Ideas built on previous ideas without the constant restart tax.

Validation came from noticing something simple: the bottleneck in AI-assisted work isn't the AI tool. It's the overhead of context management. Any system that reduces that overhead multiplies productivity. The method worked because it was built from the actual friction point—not the tool, but the disconnection between tools.

What this taught me: tools are only as good as the continuity they can maintain. The craft lives not in picking the "best" tool, but in building systems around tools that preserve what matters across their limitations. Every tool resets. The question is what survives the reset.
