# Photogeography

I built a method for making visible the relationship between place and perception. Not just a photo project—a system for capturing how a location shapes what you see in it and what you see through it.

The constraint was both technical and phenomenological. How do you photograph place in a way that shows not just what's there, but how being there changes what you see? How do you capture the experience of presence, not just the fact of location? Early attempts treated the photographs as documentary. That missed the point. Photography is always interpretation. The question was how to make the interpretation visible.

What broke showed up in the disconnect between photo and place. I'd return to a location and photograph it differently, not because the location changed, but because I had changed. My perception had shifted. The relationship between observer and observed had transformed. But the photographs looked like separate images of the same place. The actual work—the thinking that had evolved through visiting, noticing, returning—that was invisible.

The breakthrough came from recognizing that the project wasn't really about geography. It was about attention. How do you document the deepening of attention? How do you show what it means to actually see a place, not just photograph it?

What emerged through 147 documented moments was a method that treated location as a scaffold for understanding. Each return to a place, I tracked not just what I photographed, but what I noticed that I hadn't noticed before. What shifted in my awareness. What the place revealed about itself, and about me, through repeated attention.

The structure proved itself when the images became a record of how seeing deepens. Not a portfolio of beautiful photographs. A documentation of perception. When someone could look at the series and trace not just the place, but the relationship with the place changing over time.

Testing it meant returning to locations repeatedly. When the work showed something real about attention and place that photography usually misses. When the images held evidence of the thinking that had happened while making them.

Validation came from recognizing patterns across locations. Different geographies, but the same arc appeared in each: initial perception, deepening attention, integration of place into understanding. The method held across contexts because it was built from something true about how perception actually works.

What this taught me: the strongest work doesn't document the world. It documents the observer in relationship with the world. Photogeography works because it refuses to pretend the photographer is invisible. It makes that relationship—attention, presence, transformation through seeing—the actual subject. The craft lives not in the perfection of the image, but in the honesty about what presence means.
