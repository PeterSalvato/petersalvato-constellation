# Monstrum

I built a taxonomy that holds contradictory creative work. Not a categorization system—a frame that lets different projects live in the same space without collapsing into each other.

The constraint emerged slowly. I started with a simple question: help me design a poster for a school project. Then: help me structure a business. Then: help me understand web architecture. Then: help me plan meal systems for my family. Then: tell me what you know about me. Each question was real. Each one pulled in a different direction. A design problem. A business problem. A technical problem. A personal knowledge problem. A creative identity problem.

The friction surfaced when I started trying to organize the work. I had expertise that spanned domains. But every time I tried to put it into a linear portfolio structure, something broke. The Aiden-Jae work wasn't just design—it was brand strategy. The Modernist Homestead wasn't just consulting—it was lifestyle curation. The portfolio site itself wasn't just front-end engineering—it was information architecture and copywriting and identity work. The moment I tried to fit work into clean category boundaries, I felt the system reject it. The joints didn't hold.

I kept asking collaborators: "Act as an expert in information architecture and help me structure this." "Act as an expert in business and help me plan that." But the ask itself was the problem. I wasn't actually one thing. I was a generalist with specific depths. The work compounded. It didn't separate.

The real problem wasn't organizational. It was conceptual. How do you describe what you do when what you do doesn't fit existing categories? I had spent years crossing between domains—design to engineering, business to creative, technical to intuitive. The work that mattered most often happened at those seams. But the language of portfolio work forced separation.

Over nearly three years, 290 documented moments across platforms, the shape of an answer emerged. Not through trying to fit myself into existing frames. But through accepting what was actually there and building language for it.

What I realized: the resistance to categorization wasn't a flaw. It was signal. The best work didn't fit neat labels because it had to hold multiple concerns simultaneously. The Aetherwright work required identity thinking, design systems thinking, and occult thinking all at once. The Homestead work required aesthetics, engineering constraint, and personal mythology. The work was contradictory by necessity.

So Monstrum became a taxonomy that doesn't resolve contradiction—it acknowledges it. It holds parallel concerns without forcing hierarchy. It says: this work is simultaneously multiple things. It demonstrates that thinking across domains isn't a liability. It's where the craft density lives.

The structure proved itself when I could look at my actual work and feel like it was represented. Not simplified. Not forced into convenient categories. Seen. The Monstrum taxonomy doesn't make the contradiction disappear. It makes the contradiction visible and honorable. That's the difference between a taxonomy that describes work and one that shapes what work becomes possible.

Validation came through use over years. Projects that didn't fit traditional design or engineering or business categories started making sense when I stopped trying to make them fit. Collaborators could understand what I was actually offering without me having to apologize for the category-crossing. The framework survived the test of time because it was built from the actual shape of the work, not imposed on it.

What this taught me: when a system rejects your work, check first whether the system is wrong. Often it is. Build your categories from what you actually do, not from how work is conventionally described. The monster—the thing that doesn't fit—often has better fidelity to reality than the clean frames. The craft is not in the categories. It's in the accuracy of the observation about what matters.
