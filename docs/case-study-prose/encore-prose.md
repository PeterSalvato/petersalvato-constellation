I built a platform for surfacing and managing musical revisions. Not a version control system—a method for tracking the evolution of a musical piece when each version explores a different question about what the piece is.

The constraint was musical and conceptual. When composing, I create multiple versions of a piece. Not iterations toward a final form. Different explorations. This version asks: what if the piece is rhythmic? This one asks: what if it's harmonic? This one asks: what if it's minimal? Each version is valid. Each teaches something different. But I'd lose track of which version held which discovery. I'd re-solve problems I'd already solved. I'd lose versions that had something essential even if they didn't "win."

What broke showed up in the inability to hold the full ecosystem of versions. A piece would have six versions in my files. I'd only remember three. The fourth version—which had a detail I needed—would be lost. I'd reference it in my mind as "that version with the interesting texture" but never find it. The thinking that had gone into creating each version was invisible.

The turning point came from recognizing that the work wasn't in any single "final" version. The work was in the exploration across versions. Each version was a thought. What if I made that thinking visible and navigable?

What emerged through 38 documented moments was a system that treated each version as a perspective on the piece. Not "better" or "worse," but "differently exploring the same material." The platform made it possible to see all versions, understand what each was asking, and move between them. To see which details from version three worked in version five. To recognize when you'd abandoned an idea too quickly.

The structure proved itself when I could explore a piece knowing I had captured all the thinking. When old versions weren't dead ends but resources. When a piece could incorporate discoveries from multiple versions without losing the coherence of any single approach.

Testing it meant composing new pieces with the system. Did it capture what I'd intended? Could I return to a composition and recognize the shape of how I'd been thinking? Could I mix and match discoveries across versions without the final piece feeling fragmented?

Validation came from watching pieces mature. The pieces created with the system held more dimension. They incorporated more genuine exploration because the system made it possible to preserve and draw from multiple approaches. The final form was stronger because it was informed by a fully-documented creative journey.

What this taught me: creative work accumulates. Every version holds knowledge, even if it doesn't become "the" final piece. The craft lives not in achieving a single perfect form, but in having the discipline and tools to learn from every version you create. The system works because it honors the full ecosystem of exploration, not just the final output.
