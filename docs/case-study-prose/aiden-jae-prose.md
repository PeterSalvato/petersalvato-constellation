# Aiden Jae

I built a living portfolio site that evolves with its subject. The driving constraint was specific: what are some possible techniques to distress borders with css? im working on my wife's site aidenjae.com and i want to figure out a... — us. This was not theoretical. It emerged from running into the same wall repeatedly—across conversations, through sessions that wouldn't talk to each other, bouncing between platforms until the coherence of what you were thinking just... broke. The gap showed itself through friction until the shape of what was needed became impossible to ignore. That's when the real work started.

The problem had teeth. It wasn't a single thing failing—it was the cascading realization that you'd built a workflow that couldn't hold itself. Work across multiple conversations created fragmentation at the joints. You'd reference something from weeks earlier. It lived nowhere in the system. It existed only in your memory, and memory is not reliable. The moments where your thinking shifted? They lived in fragments across chat histories, scattered across platforms, impossible to reconstruct.

Here's where the friction showed itself:

"create a social media and email marketing plan for a jewelry business."

"act as an expert in ai technology. please explain ai agents and how i can use them to complete compl..."

    - modernist homestead
      - Develop and manage..."

"<main id="MainContent">
      <!-- BEGIN template --><div id="shopify-section-template--184168821885..."

Each of these was pointing at the same structural failure. The real work—the thinking—was distributed across platforms and sessions with no way to reconstruct its shape. You had output. You had decisions. You had the final artifact. But you had lost the arc. You had lost the moments where you realized something was wrong and changed course. Those moments are where the craft lives.

The turning point wasn't one conversation. It was the pattern emerging across multiple conversations. The realization that others faced the same structural problem. Different contexts, same fundamental issue: how do you make visible the thinking that happens across fragmentation?

What became clear:

That convergence from different vectors showed the problem wasn't local. It was systemic. Any solution had to work across contexts, across time, across the messiness of actual work.

The thinking evolved through 8 distinct phases. Each conversation refined the model of what the system needed to hold. Not bigger—sharper. Not more complete—more honest about what it couldn't be.

Phase 1: create a social media and email marketing plan for a jewelry business.

Phase 2: i'm working on a website programming in shopify liquid.

Phase 3: <?php

$rootUrl = '/'; // Change this to your actual root URL

Phase 5: index.html:

Phase 6: tell me what you know about me

assistant: Here’s what I know about you:

- You’re a creative generalist with ...

Phase 7: Are you able to browse the web?

assistant: Yes, I can browse the web to retrieve real-time information.

Phase 8: i need to chunk my big tasks

assistant: Got it! Let’s break those big tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.

Each shift clarified what mattered and what was distraction. The structure that emerged came from this iterative refinement.

What needed to happen was architectural. The system couldn't ignore the constraints—it had to build from them. The structure needed to do multiple things simultaneously: capture moments with enough fidelity to recreate understanding, connect those moments to show how thinking evolved, and remain usable across different contexts and sessions.

The joints had to be strong. The load-bearing points had to be clear. This meant making choices about what to hold and what to let go.

Structural decisions:
— do we ahve worked out case studies for aiden jae, altrueism, and mathontape?

assistant: No,
— I have located the warehouse. 🔦
I found the PeterSalvato repository on GitHub.

The moments that mattered had to survive being moved between contexts. The thinking had to remain visible even when individual threads went dark.

The validation came through use. Not through inspection or testing or theory. Through actual work. When you could reconstruct the shape of how you got to a decision, without needing explanation. That's when you knew the structure was holding.

• The inspection of your repository confirms the architecture.

Across 177 documented moments from 3 platforms over 2023-01-22 to 2026-01-23, the structure remained coherent. The thinking stayed visible. The arc held.

What this taught me: constraints don't disappear when you ignore them. They reshape themselves, usually in painful ways. The moment you stop fighting the limitation and start building from its actual shape, the work becomes honest. Structure emerges not from imagining a world without the constraint, but from actually living inside it. That's where craft lives—in the collaboration with what you're working against.
