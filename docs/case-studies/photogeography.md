# Case Study: Photogeography

## The Constraint

What if you couldn't crop? What if the frame was fixed before you pressed the shutter?

## The Problem

Most photography pretends to be objective. But the frame is always a choice. The photographer decides what's in and what's out. The crop happens before or after, but it always happens.

This makes photography a game of composition—arranging the world to fit the rectangle you want.

The question: what if you accepted the rectangle you got?

## The Approach: Locked Aspect Ratios

Three locked aspect ratios. No cropping. No reframing. The photograph holds the shape it arrived in.

**Format as honest evidence:** The 3:2 of 35mm film. The constraint of the Minolta's viewfinder. Whatever fell inside the frame at the moment of exposure—that's the image.

**Geography as content:** Longitude and latitude embedded in each piece. The photograph isn't just an image—it's a record of where someone stood at a moment in time.

**Constraint forces seeing:** When you can't crop, you have to see differently before you shoot. The limitation trains attention.

## The Archive

Personal 35mm photography. Minolta camera. Standard 3:2 ratio.

Each image paired with geographic coordinates. Available as prints and digital formats. A visual archive that isn't trying to be pretty—just present.

## What It Proves

Photogeography demonstrates that:

1. **Constraints are pedagogical.** The inability to crop teaches seeing. The limitation becomes the lesson.

2. **Format is meaning.** The aspect ratio isn't neutral. It's a decision that shapes everything inside it.

3. **Geography anchors image.** When the location is part of the work, the photograph stops being abstract. It becomes evidence.

4. **Rigid grids generate emergence.** The fixed frame doesn't limit what can be found—it reveals what was already there.

## Current State

In development. The archive grows.
