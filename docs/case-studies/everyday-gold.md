# Case Study: Everyday Gold

## The Constraint

How do you build a product system where regulatory compliance becomes a design advantage? Where legal requirements don't fight the aesthetic—they enhance it?

---

## The Problem

Fragrance commerce demands precision. Scent variants require modular labeling. Trademark clearance gates every name choice. Regulatory information (ingredients, warnings, volume) must appear prominently.

Most brands treat this as burden—fine print crammed into whatever space remains after the "real" design is done. The regulations fight the aesthetics.

The question: what if regulatory compliance was first-class design content?

## The Approach: Swiss-Style Label System

The solution drew on information design principles: treat complex data as an opportunity for clarity, not an obstacle to beauty.

**Grid-first architecture:** Every label follows a strict Swiss-style grid. Text blocks align. White space is intentional. The structure accommodates variable content (different scent names, different ingredient lists) without requiring per-variant design decisions.

**Trademark research as design input:** Before any name is finalized, trademark search happens. Class 3 (cosmetics) clearance. Domain availability. Social handle availability. The legal work informs the design work, not the other way around.

**Regulatory information as typography:** Ingredient lists, volume markings, warnings—these become typographic elements with intentional hierarchy. The legally-required information is set with the same care as the brand name. Nothing looks like an afterthought.

**Modular variant system:** Each scent variant slots into the same label architecture. "Sweet Dawn" uses the same grid as "Night Bloom." Production can scale without design bottleneck.

## The Implementation

**Logotype development:** "Everyday Gold" with deliberate typographic character—warmth without losing precision.

**Variant naming system:** Each scent gets a name that works legally (trademark clear), poetically (evocative of the scent), and systematically (fits the label grid).

**Label production logic:** Templates that adapt to regulatory requirements across markets. What's required in the US differs from what's required in EU. The system handles both.

## What It Proves

Everyday Gold demonstrates that:

1. **Constraints can be compositional.** Regulatory requirements, properly treated, become structure rather than clutter.

2. **Modular design scales.** One grid system handles an expanding product line. New scents don't require new design decisions.

3. **Legal and creative work can integrate.** Trademark research happening *before* design commitment prevents expensive pivots.

4. **Swiss-style principles apply everywhere.** The same grid logic that organizes complex data visualizations organizes product labels.

## Current State

Specified. Label system complete. Production ready for scent variants.

The grid holds. New products enter the system without disrupting it.
