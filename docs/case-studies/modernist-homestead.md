# Case Study: Modernist Homestead

## The Constraint

How do you run a household when willpower is unreliable? When executive function fails? When medical complexity makes every meal a decision tree?

## The Problem

ADHD + autism + celiac disease + five culinary traditions + cross-border relocation.

That's not a lifestyle. That's a systems engineering problem.

Willpower-dependent household management fails under these conditions. "I'll figure out dinner tonight" becomes no dinner. "I'll remember the dietary restrictions" becomes a medical incident. "I'll manage the cognitive load" becomes paralysis.

Traditional homemaking advice assumes neurotypical executive function. It doesn't work.

## The Approach: Zero-Willpower Systems

The solution: treat domestic life as infrastructure. Every default decision is structural, not willful. The system handles what the brain can't.

**Culinary modularity:** Multiple traditions (Italian, Jewish, Puerto Rican, Southern, modernist) broken into interoperable components. A sauce from one tradition works with a technique from another. Recipes aren't instructions—they're assemblies from a parts library.

**Celiac as design constraint:** Gluten-free isn't a substitution layer applied to "normal" cooking. It's the foundation. Every recipe starts gluten-free. The constraint shapes the system, not the other way around.

**Executive function scaffolding:** Meal planning that doesn't require deciding. Inventory systems that surface what needs to be used. Prep workflows that break tasks into completable units. The system compensates for what the brain can't maintain.

**Medical complexity as first-class concern:** Dietary restrictions, medication interactions, sensory sensitivities—these aren't footnotes. They're load-bearing requirements. The system doesn't work if it doesn't handle them.

## The Implementation

**Batch systems:** Prep in bulk. Store in standard portions. Meals assemble rather than cook. The work happens once; the benefit repeats.

**Inventory protocols:** Know what exists. Know what's expiring. Surface what needs to be used before it goes bad. Reduce the cognitive load of "what do we have?"

**Process documentation:** Recipes that work for brains that forget. Not "cook until done" but specific times, temperatures, and indicators. Replicable by anyone in the household.

**Sensory constraint mapping:** Which textures work. Which don't. Which sounds are overwhelming. The system routes around problems rather than pushing through them.

## What It Proves

Modernist Homestead demonstrates that:

1. **Systems thinking applies to everything.** The same rigor that governs enterprise software can govern a kitchen. The discipline transfers.

2. **Constraints are generative.** Celiac disease, neurodivergence, medical complexity—these force better systems. The solutions are more robust because they can't rely on workarounds.

3. **Willpower is not a resource.** Systems that depend on willpower fail when willpower fails. Systems that don't depend on willpower keep working.

4. **Domestic infrastructure is real infrastructure.** Running a household is engineering. Pretending otherwise is why households fail.

## Current State

Active. The family operates.

Meals get made. Medical constraints get managed. The cognitive load is carried by systems, not by people trying harder. The structure holds so the humans don't have to.
