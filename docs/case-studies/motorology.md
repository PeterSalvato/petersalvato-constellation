# Case Study: Motorology

## The Constraint

What if automotive subcultures were documented like academic disciplines? What if baja bugs and donks were specimens in a taxonomy?

## The Problem

Car culture produces highly defined styling categories. Baja bug. Hot rod. Campervan. Gasser. Donk. Overlander. Rat rod. Each has distinctive visual characteristics, cultural associations, and community norms.

These categories exist, but they're not catalogued. Car enthusiasts know them intuitively. Outsiders miss the distinctions entirely. The taxonomy is oral tradition, not documentation.

The question: what if these automotive subcultures were treated as subjects of academic study?

## The Approach: Clinical Description of Enthusiasm

Fake scientific subject of study. Trading card format. Data description style borrowed from museum placards and field guides.

**Taxonomic structure:** Category name. Visual characteristics. Origin story. Geographic distribution. Cultural significance. The format of natural history applied to car culture.

**Earnest documentation:** The styling is distinctive. The communities are real. The modifications are specific. Treating them with academic seriousness reveals how much engineering and aesthetics these subcultures contain.

**Visual reference:** Poster and trading card formats. The visual language of educational materials applied to enthusiast culture.

## The Categories

Each vehicle style gets its entry:

- **Baja Bug:** Volkswagen Beetle modified for desert racing
- **Hot Rod:** Pre-1948 American cars with modified engines
- **Gasser:** Drag racing cars with raised front ends
- **Donk:** Large American sedans with oversized wheels
- **Overlander:** Expedition vehicles for extended travel
- **Rat Rod:** Deliberately unfinished, patina-preserved builds

Each documented with the same clinical precision.

## What It Proves

Motorology demonstrates that:

1. **Subcultures contain systematic knowledge.** Car modification isn't random—it follows rules, traditions, and aesthetics that can be documented.

2. **Format elevates subject.** The academic treatment reveals complexity that casual observation misses. The format teaches respect for the content.

3. **Enthusiasm is worth cataloguing.** What people care deeply about is worth studying. The subcultures persist because they matter to their communities.

4. **The same template works across domains.** Cryptozoology, Motorology, Monstrum—all use the fake academic format. The pattern is productive.

## Current State

In development. The taxonomy expanding.
