# Case Study: Encore (Cluen)

## The Constraint

How do you modernize mission-critical enterprise software without breaking it? How do you maintain visual coherence across a decade of feature additions? How do you impose order on legacy code while still shipping?

## The Stakes

Encore Max is a recruitment platform serving Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies. 40,000+ users. 2.5 million+ transactions annually. The kind of software where downtime has consequences measured in contracts lost and compliance failures.

The stack: legacy .NET Core colliding with modern web standards. Kendo jQuery toolkit for data visualization. SCSS architecture governing styles. Complex JavaScript functionality accumulated over years. A codebase large enough that no single person holds it all in their head.

The question: can you modernize without breaking mission-critical operations?

## The Tenure: 12 Years

This isn't a case study. It's a longitudinal research paper.

Most designers ship a product and leave before it breaks. This is different: living with architectural decisions for over a decade. Managing entropy. Navigating legacy code migration. Handling feature creep. Executing visual refresh cycles while maintaining operational stability.

The work divides into three eras:

**Era 1: The Migration (Engineering Focus)**

Moving from legacy stacks to modern frameworks without breaking the business. Risk mitigation through careful architectural planning. The Strangler Fig pattern applied with precision—wrapping legacy systems with modern interfaces, gradually replacing components until the old system can be retired.

Result: 99.9% uptime maintained throughout migration. No service interruption.

**Era 2: The System (UX/UI Focus)**

Building the component library. Designing the routed UI. Establishing the "grammar" of the application—consistent patterns that scale across hundreds of screens.

The `_variables.scss` file became the artifact: a design system encoded in code. Not documentation that developers ignore. Actual constraints that enforce consistency.

Third-party systems (Kendo) integrated without breaking visual coherence. The components adapted to the system, not the other way around.

**Era 3: The Governance (Art Direction Focus)**

Working daily with owners. Keeping visual fidelity high while shipping features under deadline. The tension between "this needs to look right" and "this needs to ship Tuesday."

The skill: diplomatic negotiation between design intent and business reality. Building "internal APIs"—patterns and conventions that peers actually adopt because they make work easier, not because they're mandated.

## The Position in the Portfolio

Encore occupies a specific role: the Operational Anchor.

It proves grit. It proves constraint management. It proves that the theoretical frameworks (Savepoint, Aetherwright, AI DevOps Workbench) aren't academic exercises—they're tools developed by someone who ships production software to Fortune 500 companies.

The positioning:

> "I have the grit to handle technical debt, the discipline to enforce drift control, and the diplomatic skill to build 'Internal APIs' that my peers actually use. I ship value in the real world, where things are messy."

## What It Proves

Encore demonstrates that:

1. **Long tenure is proof of durability.** Anyone can ship version 1.0. Living with a system for 12 years—managing its evolution, its entropy, its politics—proves something portfolios of short engagements never can.

2. **Constraints are materials.** Legacy code, Kendo components, business deadlines—these aren't obstacles. They're the conditions under which real architecture happens.

3. **Systems thinking applies at every altitude.** The same rigor that produces the `_variables.scss` file produces Savepoint Protocol. The discipline transfers.

4. **Design and engineering aren't separate.** Art direction, UX design, and front-end engineering on a single platform, by the same person, for over a decade. The boundaries are artificial.

## Current State

Deployed. Running. 12 years and counting.

The platform continues to serve Fortune 500 clients and federal agencies. The architecture continues to evolve. The methodology continues to hold.
