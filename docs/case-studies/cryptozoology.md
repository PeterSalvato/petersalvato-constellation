# Case Study: Cryptozoology

## The Constraint

What if folklore was documented with scientific rigor? What if the things that don't exist were catalogued as if they did?

## The Problem

Cryptids—Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, Mothman—occupy a strange space. They're not real, but they're not nothing. They're cultural artifacts, collections of sightings and stories that persist across generations.

The usual treatment is either credulous (believers) or dismissive (skeptics). Neither captures what cryptids actually are: fictional entities with cultural weight.

The question: what if cryptids were studied as cultural phenomena using the aesthetic language of science?

## The Approach: Fake Academic Rigor

A field guide format. Trading card aesthetics. Clinical data description style. The apparatus of science applied to the study of things that aren't there.

**AI-generated specimens:** Midjourney imagery creating "documentary" photographs of creatures that don't exist. The images have the character of evidence without being evidence.

**Taxonomic structure:** Latin names. Physical descriptions. Behavioral notes. Geographic distribution. The format of biological classification applied to folklore.

**Earnest documentation:** No winking. No irony markers. The work commits to its premise. The cryptids are documented as if the documentation mattered.

## The Aesthetic

Posters and trading cards. The visual language of museum displays and natural history archives. The typography and layout that say "this is serious" applied to subjects that aren't serious at all.

The tension between the formal and the fantastical is the point.

## What It Proves

Cryptozoology demonstrates that:

1. **Format carries meaning.** The apparatus of science confers legitimacy. Applying it to cryptids reveals how much authority comes from presentation rather than content.

2. **Folklore is worth studying.** Cryptids persist because they mean something to the cultures that tell stories about them. The fake field guide format takes them seriously as cultural artifacts.

3. **Constraint enables play.** The rigid format (taxonomic entries, clinical descriptions) creates space for invention. The rules make the game possible.

4. **AI generation works for fictional evidence.** The images don't need to be photographs—they need to look like photographs. The uncanny valley serves the project.

## Current State

In development. The field guide expanding.
