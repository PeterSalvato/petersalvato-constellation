# New City: Semantic Lineage

**Traced from**: 120,000-line ideation timeline + project files
**Date**: 2026-02-08

## Executive Summary

New City evolved across five distinct phases over three years:
1. **Tabletop RPG** → 2. **Solarpunk Novel** → 3. **Kishōtenketsu Structure** → 4. **Cassette Futurism Aesthetic** → 5. **Somatic Voice Development**

The project demonstrates systems thinking applied to narrative architecture: mechanics as theme, structure as meaning, constraint as revelation.

## Phase 1: Genesis (January 2023)

### Original Concept
- **Form**: Card-based tabletop RPG
- **Setting**: Tent city ("New City") surrounding a corporate starport
- **Mechanics**: Cryptographic/steganographic gameplay
- **Theme**: Urban survival, hacking corporate overlords

### Key Elements Established
- The name "New City" — references both newcomers and the ever-changing layout
- Corporate antagonists controlling resources
- Cryptography/steganography as discovery mechanism
- Urban survival skills (farming, water filtration, medicine)
- Phone app integration with QR codes

### Critical Insight
> "The breakthrough came from understanding cryptography not as a technical system, but as a narrative principle. Steganography hides information in plain sight. What if the world operated this way?"

---

## Phase 2: Novel Conversion

### The Inflection Point
> "Please convert the previous from a game concept to a novel concept for a book"

This single prompt transformed the project from game mechanics to narrative architecture.

### New Layers Added
- **Solarpunk philosophy**: Hopeful, sustainable, community-focused
- **Jungian psychology**: Archetypes, individuation, collective shadow
- **Mycological themes**: Mushrooms as connection, mycorrhizal network as decentralized data
- **Two societies**: New City (shadow) vs. The Homestead (integrated Self)

### Character Development
- **Henka (Henkakusha 変革者)**: "Bringer of change" — spirited, empathic, orphaned
- **Custos**: Keeper of The Homestead, mycologist, Mentor archetype
- **Quaero**: Technical specialist, Seeker archetype

---

## Phase 3: Structural Evolution

### Kishōtenketsu Adoption

Rejected Western three-act structure for Japanese four-act:
- **Ki (起)**: Introduction
- **Shō (承)**: Development
- **Ten (転)**: Twist (perceptual shift, not plot twist)
- **Ketsu (結)**: Resolution (integration, not conclusion)

**Why this matters**: Western structure is conflict-driven. Kishōtenketsu allows revelation through understanding, not confrontation. The protagonist doesn't defeat the antagonist—her perception shifts.

### Nested Architecture
- **4 Acts** (Kishōtenketsu macro-structure)
- **4 Beats per Act** (Kishōtenketsu micro-structure)
- **64 Total Sub-beats**
- **~65,000-95,000 words estimated**

### Alchemical Mapping
| Act | Location | Alchemical Phase | Psychological State |
|-----|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | New City | Nigredo | Shadow, chaos, survival |
| 2.1 | Journey | Albedo begins | Purification, unmasking |
| 2.2 | Homestead | Albedo continues | Reflection, meeting archetypes |
| 3 | Integration | Rubedo | Wholeness, joining collective |

## Phase 4: Aesthetic Refinement

### The Target
> "I want something that feels like Miyazaki wrote a lunarpunk Blade Runner"

### Cassette Futurism
- Lo-fi tactility with soul
- Rusted tech, analog solutions, things repaired and re-repaired
- Not neon cyberpunk—no resources for aesthetics
- Grays, browns, rust, grime
- "What still works" not "what looks good"

### Visual Palette
- **Colors**: Mud green, oxide red, cassette beige, LED blue, salt-white, bruise-grey
- **Textures**: Cracked ceramic, brushed aluminum, wet wool, flaking paint
- **Materials**: Scavenged plastic, polyresin, corded wire, rusted mesh, soil
- **Patterns**: Condensation on glass, solder lines, mushroom clusters in ports

## Phase 5: Voice Development (Current)

### The Core Problem
Finding a prose voice that renders the world through somatic perception, not exposition.

### Key Realization
> "You are not trying to express something. You are trying to hold something steady long enough for the reader to feel it."

### Voice Characteristics

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Perspective | Deep internal, no narration, only perception |
| Tone | Intimate, hushed, minimalist but not cold |
| Sensory Priority | Smell, texture, weight, sound. Sight is peripheral. |
| Emotion | Inferred via breath, tension, silence, sensory overload |
| Cadence | Lo-fi analog rhythm: irregular, stuttering, but organic |

### The Mask as Narrative Device
Henka's neurodivergent "mask" is her analytical survival mode:
- Constant threat-scanning
- Pattern recognition deployed defensively
- Hypervigilance as baseline

She doesn't know it's a mask because she's never experienced its absence. The unmasking doesn't happen by choice—it happens because the environment changes.

### Prose Directive
- Short sentences in Act 1
- Fragmented observations
- Constant scanning (threats, exits, patterns)
- Clipped, efficient, functional
- No time for reflection

---

## Thematic Integration

### Mechanics as Theme
The cryptographic/steganographic concept evolved from game mechanic to narrative principle:

> "Information exists, but hidden. Discovery requires intentional action. A location description that seems mundane to an uninformed character contains vital systems information to someone who understands how the city actually works."

### 40+ Entity Relationship Graph
The world has 40+ distinct entities (factions, institutions, infrastructure systems, environmental zones, NPC networks) in a relationship network, not hierarchy. Each connects to 5-15 others. No single entity controls the whole system.

### The Thematic Core
> "What happens when a city's infrastructure fails? Not dramatic collapse. Slow erosion. People adapt. New structures emerge. How do narratives hold when systems degrade?"

---

## What This Project Proves

### Systems Mastery Applied to Narrative

The same discipline appears in:
- **Savepoint Protocol**: Context recovery through minimal syntax
- **Order of the Aetherwright**: Symbolic governance for creative coherence
- **Encore**: 12-year enterprise platform durability
- **New City**: 40+ entity world-building with mechanics as theme

### The Recursive Pattern
Every level of New City demonstrates the same principle:
1. **Story structure** (Kishōtenketsu) encodes the theme (revelation through understanding)
2. **Game mechanics** (cryptographic discovery) encode the theme
3. **Prose style** (somatic perception) encodes the theme
4. **Character arc** (unmasking) encodes the theme

Form follows logic. The medium proves the message.

## Current State

### Structural Progress
- **Act 1 (New City)**: Fully developed — 16 sub-beats with detailed notes, prose directives, symbolism
- **Act 2.1 (Journey South)**: Fully developed — 16 sub-beats ending with arrival at Homestead
- **Act 2.2 (Discovery)**: Conceptual outline only — key events listed, no beat breakdown
- **Act 3 (Integration/Crisis)**: Conceptual outline only — key events listed, no beat breakdown

### The Arrival Scene (Act 2.1 Ketsu)
The key transitional moment: Henka reaches the Homestead perimeter. She scouts, observes, thinks she's hidden. But:

> "The TWIST: she's been seen the whole time. They approach her, not the other way around. The contact is gentle—they let her know they know. No alarm, no threat, no aggression. They understand why she was cautious—it makes sense for someone who found their way here alone. But she wasn't hiding from them. Her first experience of being seen by the Homestead happened before she arrived—she just didn't know it."

### Working Documents
- **Narrative Structure**: `/NewCity/plot/newcity-narrative-structure-working.md` (824 lines)
- **Full Roughout**: `/NewCity/resources/NewCity_FullRoughout_Claude_PreClean.md` (massive HTML export of development conversations)
- **Voice Brief**: Established in late development — "Miyazaki wrote a lunarpunk Blade Runner"

### Open Questions
1. What's the "small object" Henka has always carried?
2. Full beat breakdown for Acts 2.2 and 3
3. The old man scene — what did she do that made him call her Henkakusha?

### Next Work
- Actual prose drafting with cassette futurism voice
- Develop Act 2.2 and 3 beat structures

## Key Quotes from Development

On the discovery mechanic:
> "Clues are embedded in worldbuilding details, but only reveal themselves when players have the right 'key' (acquired knowledge, mechanical proficiency, relationship to NPCs). A location description contains hidden information that remains invisible until you have the right framework to perceive it."

On the protagonist:
> "Her mask is not social performance in the neurotypical sense—it's her analytical survival mode. In New City, this kept her alive. She doesn't know it's a mask because she's never experienced its absence."

On the voice:
> "The prose should not rush. It should not resolve. It should not cathart. It should feel like a constant load that never quite lifts."

On the aesthetic:
> "Moss growing on silicone, lantern light refracted in diesel puddles. Anti-cyberpunk—tender, not cool."
