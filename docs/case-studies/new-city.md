# Case Study: New City

## The Constraint

How do narratives hold when systems degrade? What happens when infrastructure fails—not dramatically, but slowly, incrementally, until people adapt and new structures emerge?

---

## The Problem

Most collapse fiction focuses on the event. The bomb. The plague. The moment everything changes. But real infrastructure failure rarely looks like that. It looks like services getting worse. It looks like workarounds becoming permanent. It looks like people building parallel systems because the official ones stopped working.

The question: what kind of story emerges from slow erosion rather than sudden collapse?

## The Approach: Nested Narrative Structures

A novel and game built on Kishōtenketsu—the four-act Japanese narrative structure—nested within a Hero's Journey macro arc. Not one or the other, but both operating at different scales.

**Kishōtenketsu for scenes:** Introduction, development, twist, reconciliation. No conflict-driven plot beats. Events unfold, perspectives shift, understanding deepens.

**Hero's Journey for the arc:** The protagonist's transformation from outsider to agent of change. The archetypal pattern providing forward momentum while individual scenes resist Western narrative aggression.

**40+ entity knowledge graph:** Characters, factions, locations, technologies, histories—all documented and cross-referenced. The world is a system before it's a story.

## The World

**Brooklyn/Sunset Park as geographic model:** A real place, mapped and transformed. The infrastructure that exists becomes the infrastructure that fails. The neighborhoods that exist become the neighborhoods that adapt.

**Henka—the neurodivergent protagonist:** Henkakusha (変革者)—"bringer of change." A character coded as neurodivergent, navigating a world where different perception is both obstacle and advantage. Sensitivity to others' emotions. Pattern recognition that catches what others miss. The traits that make survival harder also make seeing clearer.

**Surveillance as pressure:** Corporate oversight. Resistance movements. The tension between those who monitor and those who evade. Not dystopia for shock value—the realistic extension of existing systems.

## The Origin Fractal

This project is the genesis point. Where recursive system thinking first took form. The world-building that preceded the protocols. The narrative architecture that taught the architectural thinking now applied elsewhere.

New City isn't a novel about systems. It's a novel that required building systems to write. The 40+ entity knowledge graph. The nested narrative structures. The geographic modeling. All of it emerged because the story demanded it.

## What It Proves

New City demonstrates that:

1. **Complex narratives need infrastructure.** A world this detailed can't be held in memory. The knowledge graph is load-bearing. The documentation enables the story.

2. **Slow erosion is narrative material.** Not all collapse is dramatic. The most realistic futures are incremental. The story that captures this captures something true.

3. **Neurodivergent perspective is generative.** Henka sees what others miss because her brain works differently. The character's traits enable the plot, not despite the traits but through them.

4. **The same rigor applies.** World-building is systems design. Character development is architecture. The skills transfer because they're the same skills.

## Current State

In development. The world building continuing to expand.

The origin fractal. Where survival means seeing, not conquering.
