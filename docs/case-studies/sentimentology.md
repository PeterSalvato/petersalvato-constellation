# Case Study: Sentimentology

## The Constraint

What if the words we lack—the feelings that have names in other languages but not in English—could be made visible? What if typography could do what vocabulary can't?

## The Problem

Some emotions have no English word. The Portuguese *saudade*—longing for something or someone you've lost. The Japanese *mono no aware*—awareness of impermanence. The Welsh *hiraeth*—homesickness for a home you can't return to.

These concepts exist. People feel them. But without words, they're hard to discuss, recognize, or share. The feelings remain private because the language doesn't reach them.

The question: what if these unnamed emotions could be given form through typography and design?

## The Approach: Visual Vocabulary

Square format—1:1 ratio, Hasselblad-inspired. Each piece features one word, one emotion, one design.

**The lexicon:**
- **Sonder:** The realization that every passerby has a life as vivid as your own
- **Hiraeth:** Homesickness for a home you can never return to
- **Limerence:** The state of being infatuated with another person
- **Petrichor:** The smell of earth after rain
- **Numinous:** The sense of a supernatural presence
- **Vellichor:** The strange wistfulness of used bookstores
- **Solivagant:** Wandering alone
- **Clinomania:** The excessive desire to stay in bed
- **Anemoia:** Nostalgia for a time you've never known
- **Resfeber:** The restless anticipation before a journey

**Typography as carrier:** The typeface, the weight, the spacing—these do the work of definition. The word isn't just labeled. It's embodied.

## The Format

Square posters. Print and digital. Each word standing alone, given the space to mean something.

The clinical aesthetic of taxonomy applied to emotional experience. Fake academic rigor documenting real human feeling.

## What It Proves

Sentimentology demonstrates that:

1. **Language gaps are designable.** What vocabulary can't do, typography might. The visual form carries meaning the letters alone don't have.

2. **Obscure words resonate.** These terms go viral for a reason. People recognize the feelings even without having had words for them. The project gives form to that recognition.

3. **The -ology format applies to feeling.** The same clinical documentation used for cryptids and cars works for emotions. The constraint produces character.

4. **Square format forces attention.** The 1:1 ratio doesn't privilege horizontal or vertical. It centers. The constraint focuses.

## Current State

In development. The first batch of words selected. The visual vocabulary expanding.
