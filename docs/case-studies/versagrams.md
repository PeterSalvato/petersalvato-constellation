# Case Study: Versagrams

## The Constraint

What happens when typography and image are both constrained—and must work together?

---

## The Problem

Typography alone can't convey feeling. It describes, but it doesn't show. Image alone can't hold structure. It evokes, but it doesn't organize.

The usual solution is to let one dominate. Either the image illustrates the text, or the text captions the image. One serves the other.

The question: what if both were constrained, and the constraint forced them into genuine collaboration?

## The Approach: Fixed Rules, Emergent Results

Typography paired with AI-generated imagery under fixed constraints.

**Fixed typographic rules:** Specific typefaces. Specific hierarchies. Specific grid positions. The typography doesn't adapt to the image—it holds its form.

**Parametric image generation:** AI imagery generated from verse. Not illustration—emergence. The image responds to the text without depicting it literally.

**Polaroid format:** SX-70-inspired vertical ratio. Song title, AI-generated image based on lyrics, lyrics beneath, metadata and QR code. The format is the constraint that holds everything together.

## The Content

Song lyric posters. The lyrics provide the verse; the AI provides the visual. Neither dominates. Both are constrained. The combination produces something neither could alone.

Verse made visible through letter and image.

## What It Proves

Versagrams demonstrates that:

1. **Constraint creates collaboration.** When neither element can dominate, both must adapt. The limitation forces integration.

2. **Feeling can be encoded.** The combination of fixed typography and generative imagery produces emotional resonance systematically—not accidentally.

3. **AI generation works under constraint.** The parametric image isn't random—it's responding to text within rules. The system has character.

4. **The intersection of structure and generation is fertile.** Where fixed rules meet emergent output, surprising things happen.

## Current State

In development. The format proving itself.
