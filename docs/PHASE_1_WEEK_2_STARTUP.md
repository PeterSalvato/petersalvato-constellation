## Project 1: Savepoint Protocol Case Study Rebuild

**Current:** `_protocols/savepoint-protocol.md` (108 lines, 9.1K chars)
**Target:** 400-600 lines, 40-50K chars (4-5x expansion)
**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Source Material:**
- Current case study (read first to understand existing narrative)
- Savepoint Protocol extraction timeline (1,734 blocks available)
- Savepoint Protocol quotes from EXTRACTION_MINING_RESULTS.md (8 key moments identified)

### Your Assignment

1. **Read Current Case Study**
   - Open `_protocols/savepoint-protocol.md`
   - Understand existing structure and narrative
   - Note what's currently emphasized

2. **Review Extraction Content**
   - Go to EXTRACTION_MINING_RESULTS.md
   - Find "Savepoint Protocol" section
   - Read 8 key moments with their quotes

3. **Apply Content Architecture Template**
   - Using CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md
   - Map extraction content to each section (1-6)
   - Decide how much depth per section

4. **Rebuild Case Study by Section**

   **Section 1: OPENING STATEMENT** (500-700 words)
   - What cognitive problem is Savepoint solving?
   - Why did this matter to you?
   - What gap was there?
   - Use extraction moment 1-2 if appropriate

   **Section 2: THE THINKING** (800-1000 words)
   - What constraints were identified?
   - Why this approach vs. alternatives?
   - What was the core insight?
   - Use extraction moments about cognitive turning points, transformation vs. documentation
   - Cite 2-3 extraction moments from mining results

   **Section 3: THE BUILDING** (1000-1200 words)
   - How was this actually built?
   - What were the key technical/design decisions?
   - Why each decision?
   - How did constraints shape choices?
   - Integrate extraction quotes showing decision-making
   - Cite 3-4 extraction moments

   **Section 4: WHAT SURVIVED** (500-700 words)
   - What worked as expected?
   - What needed refinement?
   - What failed and how did you recover?
   - Did the tool work as imagined?
   - Cite 1-2 extraction moments

   **Section 5: THE SYSTEM** (600-800 words)
   - How do narrative/technical/cognitive systems work together?
   - Why is Savepoint "narrative infrastructure"?
   - How does it serve other projects?
   - Show cross-project connections
   - Cite 1-2 extraction moments

   **Section 6: THE LEARNING** (400-600 words)
   - What would you do differently?
   - What principles are transferable?
   - How does this inform other work?
   - What's the deeper pattern?
   - Cite 1 extraction moment

5. **Voice Check**
   - Read aloud (literally)
   - Does it sound like you?
   - Every sentence pass the peer test?
   - Remove marketing language

6. **Extraction Verification**
   - Every quote is verbatim to EXTRACTION_MINING_RESULTS.md
   - Context is accurate
   - Quotes flow naturally (not forced)
   - Citations are clear

7. **Save and Stage**
   - Update `_protocols/savepoint-protocol.md` with rebuilt content
   - Maintain original frontmatter (layout, title, etc.)
   - Just replace the content body

---

## Project 2: Modernist Homestead Case Study Rebuild

**Current:** `_systems/modernist-homestead.md` (115 lines, 7.3K chars)
**Target:** 400-600 lines, 30-50K chars (4-5x expansion)
**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Source Material:**
- Current case study (understand existing narrative)
- Modernist Homestead extraction timeline (1,141 blocks available)
- Modernist Homestead quotes from EXTRACTION_MINING_RESULTS.md (8 key moments identified)

### Your Assignment

Same process as Savepoint Protocol:

1. **Read Current Case Study** — Understand existing structure
2. **Review Extraction Content** — 8 key moments + quotes from mining results
3. **Apply Content Architecture Template** — Map to sections 1-6
4. **Rebuild by Section** — Apply same structure (opening → thinking → building → survived → system → learning)
5. **Voice Check** — Read-aloud test, peer conversation standard
6. **Extraction Verification** — Verbatim, contextualized, natural flow
7. **Save and Stage** — Update `_systems/modernist-homestead.md`

**Homestead-Specific Sections:**
- **Section 2 (The Thinking):** Neurodivergent systems thinking, space as prosthetic, sensory regulation, executive function encoded into physical design
- **Section 3 (The Building):** How physical space, growing systems, cooking systems, household rituals all support cognitive function
- **Section 5 (The System):** How narrative (family governance) + visual (spatial design) + technical (system integration) work together
- **Section 6 (The Learning):** What universal principles about prosthetic systems apply elsewhere

## How to Rebuild (Step-by-Step)

### Example: Building Section 2 (The Thinking) for Savepoint Protocol

**Step 1:** Open EXTRACTION_MINING_RESULTS.md, find Savepoint Protocol section

**Step 2:** Identify moments that map to Section 2
- Look for "Maps To: Section 2" in mining results
- Read the full quotes

**Step 3:** Understand what Section 2 should accomplish
- From CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md:
- "Key constraints identified and why certain approaches were chosen"
- Word count target: 800-1000 words

**Step 4:** Plan the section
- What constraints does the mining reveal?
- How did constraints shape the approach?
- What alternatives were considered?
- Why this direction over that one?

**Step 5:** Write the section
- Open with constraint identification
- Show how constraints drove thinking
- Integrate extraction quotes (2-3 quotes for this section)
- End with "This led to building..."
- Total: 800-1000 words

**Step 6:** Voice check
- Read aloud
- Does it sound like you?
- Any marketing language?
- Any jargon without earning it?
- Any aspirational tone?

**Step 7:** Integration check
- Does this quote flow naturally or feel forced?
- Is the quote context preserved?
- Does the quote illuminate thinking or just fill space?

- ✓ 400-600 lines each (4-5x expansion substantive, not padding)
- ✓ Master Builder voice throughout (passes read-aloud test)
- ✓ 100% extraction quote accuracy (verbatim to mining results)
- ✓ Quotes flow naturally (not forced)
- ✓ Markdown valid
- ✓ Site builds without errors (`bundle exec jekyll serve`)
- ✓ Thinking is visible (not just outcomes)
- ✓ Process is visible (constraints, decisions, rationale)
- ✓ Cross-project connections shown (where applicable)

## If You Get Stuck

**Question:** "How do I integrate a quote naturally?"
**Answer:** It should feel like the quote is finishing a thought you started, not interrupting your narrative.
- Bad: "The system was designed. 'This was important.' We built it."
- Good: "The key insight was that transformation, not documentation, was the core insight. As one conversation explored: '[quoted thinking about transformation]'"

**Question:** "How much expansion is too much?"
**Answer:** 4-5x is the target (9K → 40-50K). If a section hits 2,000 words and feels complete, don't pad it. Quality over length.

**Question:** "Should I reference other projects?"
**Answer:** Yes, where natural. Savepoint informs other projects. Homestead principles apply elsewhere. Show these connections briefly.

**Question:** "What if current case study is really good?"
**Answer:** Don't replace it entirely. Expand it with extraction content. Keep what's good, add thinking/process visibility.

## Commit Instructions (After Friday Approval)

```bash
cd /home/peter/homelab/projects/active/petersalvato.com

# Stage the rebuilt case studies
git add _protocols/savepoint-protocol.md
git add _systems/modernist-homestead.md

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "refactor: Phase 1 Week 2 - Rebuild case studies with extraction-integrated content

- _protocols/savepoint-protocol.md: Rebuilt with thinking/process visible (9.1K → 40-50K chars)
- _systems/modernist-homestead.md: Rebuilt with thinking/process visible (7.3K → 40-50K chars)

Both case studies now show:

## Next: Week 3 (After Week 2 Approval)

Once Week 2 is approved, Week 3 begins:
- Rebuild Aiden Jae case study (6-8 hours)
- Rebuild New City case study (6-8 hours)
- Rebuild Order of the Aetherwright case study (6-8 hours)

Same approach, different projects, 5 case studies total by end of Phase 1.

But that's Week 3. For now, focus on finishing Week 2 by Friday.
