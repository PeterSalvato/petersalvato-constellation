# THE WORK

Visual systems don't stay coherent by accident. They drift. Organizations grow, teams change, new products launch—and suddenly the brand is four different things.

I've built identity systems for luxury brands that had to stay consistent across e-commerce, print, retail, campaigns, and social. Same DNA everywhere. No contradictions.

# EXAMPLES

### Aiden Jae
Fine jewelry. Handmade pieces that also need to function at commercial scale. The identity system had to work from a single sketch through global campaigns. Modular. Respectful of the craft without romanticizing it.

### Altrueism
Luxury goods brand. The visual system had to speak both heritage and innovation—not as contradiction, but as evolution. It scaled across 40+ products while maintaining a single voice. Hierarchical typography and modular color meant designers could make decisions within constraints, not around them.

### Everyday Gold
Omnichannel commerce. High-end craft meeting digital storefronts. The system established baseline rules—typography, spacing, imagery, interaction—that let distributed teams extend the brand without breaking it. No gatekeeping. Clear rules instead.

# THE STRUCTURE

**Hierarchical components.** Visual elements organized by priority and context. Hero, supporting, utility. Everyone knows which level they're working at.

**Constraints as tools.** Rules are additive, not subtractive. Designers work within boundaries to make better decisions, not worse ones.

**Drift management.** It happens anyway. The system measures it, quantifies it, and provides frameworks for deciding when drift becomes permission and when it becomes corruption.

**Survival.** The identity has to outlive team changes, organizational growth, and technical migration. Most don't. The ones that do are built to.

# THE RESULTS

These systems have maintained visual coherence across $10M+ in annual commerce, held brand integrity through team transitions, and given distributed teams clear frameworks for extending identity into new contexts. No gatekeeping. No magic. Just structure.
