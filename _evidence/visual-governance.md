# 1.0 SCOPE

Visual Governance is the discipline of maintaining coherent visual identity across multiple product vectors, stakeholders, and technological paradigms.

I have architected identity systems for luxury commerce brands that operate across:
- E-commerce platforms
- Print collateral and packaging
- Physical retail environments
- Digital marketing campaigns
- Social media presence

# 2.0 SELECTED WORKS

### Aiden Jae
**Type:** Tokenized Identity System for Fine Jewelry
**Role:** Principal Designer
Fine jewelry requires a taxonomy that respects both artisanal craft and commercial scale. The Aiden Jae system uses modular identity components that scale from a single handwritten sketch to a global campaign.

### Altrueism
**Type:** Brand Identity System
**Role:** Principal Designer
A luxury goods brand requiring a visual system that communicates both heritage and innovation. The system uses hierarchical typography and modular color theory to maintain coherence across 40+ SKUs.

### Everyday Gold
**Type:** E-Commerce Platform
**Role:** Principal Designer
An omnichannel commerce platform that required a unified visual language bridging high-end craft and digital commerce. The system establishes baseline rules for typography, spacing, imagery, and interaction, allowing distributed teams to maintain brand integrity at scale.

# 3.0 PRINCIPLES

1. **Hierarchical Tokenization:** Visual components are organized by priority and context (hero, supporting, utility)
2. **Constraint-Based Design:** Rules are additive, not subtractive. Designers work within constraints to generate novelty
3. **Drift Control:** Systematic drift happens. The system measures it, quantifies it, and provides decision frameworks for managing it
4. **Scalable Coherence:** Identity systems must survive organizational growth, team turnover, and technological change

# 4.0 OUTCOME

These systems have sustained visual coherence across $10M+ in annual commerce, maintained brand integrity through team transitions, and provided clear decision frameworks for extending identity into new contexts.
