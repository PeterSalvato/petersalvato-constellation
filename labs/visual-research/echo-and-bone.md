# Echo & Bone
*A visual research study exploring the intersection of typography, memory, and material culture.*

This is a sandbox project — no client, no constraints, pure formal exploration.

## The Premise
What happens when you treat typography as **archaeological artifact** rather than communication tool?

## The Method
1. Selected a base typeface (high-contrast serif)
2. Applied "weathering" transformations (erosion, fragmentation, layering)
3. Tested legibility thresholds (where does text become texture?)

## The Output
A series of typographic compositions that exist at the boundary between **readable and decorative**.

**Status:** Research / Ongoing
