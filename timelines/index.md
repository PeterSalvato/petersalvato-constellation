## What Are These?

These timelines show the raw research and thinking behind all work. 8,922+ entries documenting conversations, decisions, experiments, and learning across two years and 20 projects.

**Format:** Extraction entries from multi-turn conversations with Claude. Chronologically organized by project.

**Voice:** Raw and unpolished. These are real-time thinking records, not edited writing. Formality varies because they represent actual working process.

## How to Use Them

### Browse by Project
Click any project name to see all entries for that project, organized chronologically by month.

### Understand the Work
Each timeline shows the thinking that shaped the final case study. See decisions as they were made, experiments as they were tried, constraints as they were discovered.

### Trace Your Thinking
Follow a single topic across months. See how understanding evolved. Notice what changed and what stayed constant.
