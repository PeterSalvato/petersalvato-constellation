    "content": "I start with the same question on every project: Where is the structural fragmentation?\n\nNot the surface symptom. The joints. The places where intent meets constraint and something either holds or breaks. The gap between what's promised and what actually works.\n\nI work across three output channels:\n\n**Narrative Systems** — How do you encode a brand story into infrastructure so it survives deployment? Aiden Jae. Altrueism. Everyday Gold. New City. The work that ensures positioning doesn't fracture when it hits technical reality.\n\n**Visual Systems** — How do you build typographic and design systems that hold under variable content and scaling? Photogeography. Versagrams. Sentimentology. Echo & Bone. The work that makes identity structural instead of decorative.\n\n**Technical Systems** — How do you build platforms and infrastructure that run for 12+ years without breaking? Encore. Portable Agency. AI DevOps Workbench. Savepoint Protocol. The work that proves the framework holds under real load.\n\nMost projects require all three working together. The diagnostic method is consistent: identify the structural fragmentation, think through alternatives, find the integration point, build it. The foundation is Visual Communication—thirty years of understanding what happens when systems collapse under pressure.\n\nThis site indexes that work. Not by department. By the actual method:\n\n**Protocols** — The frameworks that became necessary because existing tools failed.\n\n**Applied Systems** — The proof these frameworks hold under real constraints.\n\n**Practice** — The research and experimentation where principles get stress-tested."
