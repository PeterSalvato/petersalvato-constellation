    "type": "manifesto",
    "content": "Creative work dies in two ways: abandoned before it's finished, or compromised in execution.\n\nI help creative teams—designers, founders, makers, artists—ensure their vision survives deployment. I can do this in two ways:\n\n**If you have a clear vision:** I build the systems (narrative, visual, infrastructure) that make it hold. Photography systems. Brand architectures. Platforms that run for twelve years. Visual systems that don't become rigid. The infrastructure that lets creativity scale.\n\n**If the vision is broken or unclear:** I diagnose where it's fragmenting, work with you to craft positioning that's both authentic and operational, then build the systems to hold it. Altrueism. Aiden Jae. Everyday Gold. New City. Projects where creative ambition needed structural clarity before it could survive.\n\nThe work spans three domains:\n\n**Narrative & Positioning** — Brand story, world-building, strategic coherence. How does your vision become operational logic? How does the story survive when it hits constraints?\n\n**Visual Systems** — Identity, typography, design systems. How do they hold creative coherence without becoming rigid or arbitrary? How does form serve vision?\n\n**Infrastructure & Platforms** — The systems and code that run reliably enough that you can focus on the creative work. Twelve years at 99.9% uptime. Local resilience. Governance that works.\n\nMost projects require all three. The method is consistent: start with the creative vision. Identify where it fragments. Find the structural solution. Build it.\n\nThis site indexes that work:\n\n**Protocols** — The frameworks developed because existing tools failed creative teams.\n\n**Applied Systems** — Proof these frameworks hold under real creative and operational pressure.\n\n**Practice** — Research and experimentation. Where principles get stress-tested in lower-stakes creative environments."
