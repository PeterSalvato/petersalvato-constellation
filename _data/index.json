    "content": "I build sovereign, high-fidelity systems. Not products. Not SaaS. Systems designed for the gap between chaos and control.\n\nMost innovation fails because of Fidelity Drift—the growing distance between strategy, design, and implementation. By the time a product ships, the original intention has been compromised by frameworks, dependencies, and architectural shortcuts.\n\nI work at the seam of Design, Engineering, and AI Infrastructure. I am a Luthier—I build bespoke instruments because standard tools lack the resolution required for deep work.\n\nMy stack is intentionally idiosyncratic. Custom schemas. Local compute. Offline-first architecture. These choices are not over-engineering; they are Cognitive Ergonomics. They are built to scaffold the kind of rigor that prevents drift.\n\nThis site is not a portfolio. It is documentation of how a sovereign systems architect thinks. It is proof that you can build resilience \"in a vacuum,\" without corporate dependencies.\n\nWhat's here: Evidence of mastery. Underneath: Architecture. Beneath that: Philosophy."
