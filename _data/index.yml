    I build durable systems. My work sits at the intersection of design, engineering, and strategy.

    Twelve years of architecture that didn't break when pressure increased.

    I came up through screen shops and grid systems, writing type by hand and code by habit.
    Design from SVA. Published work at Random House and Sterling. Years in brands, interfaces,
    systems that had to scale without breaking.

    That foundation shaped everything: the work itself, the way I approach it, the frameworks
    I've built to understand it better.

    What's here is the visible part. Underneath is structure. Beneath that, process.
