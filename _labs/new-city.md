# 1.0 THE ENGINE

**New City is not a book; it is a dataset.**

Most authors write outlines. I architect dependencies. I have constructed a relational graph of 40+ entities (districts, transit systems, social hierarchies, resource flows) and a fully functional transit map for a fictional metropolis.

The simulation operates on basic economic principles:
- Resource extraction from the periphery (Lower Wards)
- Distribution through a hierarchical transit network
- Consumption concentrated in the center (Upper Districts)
- Systemic breakdown when transit fails

# 2.0 THE SIMULATION

**"The Keeper and the Veil"**

A stress test of the engine involving a transit strike that disconnects the wealthy "Upper Districts" from the supply chains of the "Lower Wards."

The narrative explores:
- What happens when infrastructure fails?
- How do social hierarchies respond to scarcity?
- What does power look like when supply lines are cut?

# 3.0 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

The simulation is built on:
- **Entity-Relationship Model:** 40+ entities with defined relationships
- **Transit Graph:** A directed acyclic graph representing supply chains
- **Event System:** Cascading failures triggered by a single node collapse
- **Resolution Mechanics:** How systems respond to stress

# 4.0 CURRENT STATE

The foundational dataset is complete. The first narrative sequence ("The Keeper and the Veil") is in development, with all plot nodes mapped and character dependencies documented.
