# 1.0 THE OBJECTIVE

**Optimize the human hardware.**

This lab focuses on the physical infrastructure required to sustain a neurodivergent family unit with strict biological constraints (Celiac Disease, executive function variability, sensory processing differences).

The project is driven by a single principle: **if the system requires willpower to operate, it will fail.**

# 2.0 PROTOCOLS

We do not "cook"; we execute supply chains. We design modular, batchable culinary systems rooted in Italian and Thai principles to ensure:
- Nutritional density (calories, macros, micronutrients)
- Execution simplicity (minimal cognitive load)
- Batch efficiency (prep-once, eat-many)
- Palatability (pleasure is part of nutrition)

### The Systems

**Italian Foundation**
- Stock & risotto as base (builds depth with zero active attention)
- Pasta as modular vehicle (protein, carb, structure)
- Acid/fat/heat as flavor levers (simple rules, infinite variation)

**Thai Foundation**
- Curry paste (one-pot, minimal components, maximum depth)
- Stir-fry architecture (batch prep, quick assembly)
- Fish sauce, lime, heat as flavor profile (simple, robust, resilient)

# 3.0 INFRASTRUCTURE

- **Freezer Inventory System:** Documented stock rotation and meal components
- **Prep Schedule:** Batching operations to specific days (reduce decision fatigue)
- **Recipe Database:** Templated systems, not rigid recipes (allow adaptation)
- **Nutritional Tracking:** Minimal but sufficient (confirm macros without obsession)

# 4.0 OUTCOME

A household food system that operates reliably even during periods of executive dysfunction, reduces decision fatigue by 60%, and maintains nutritional standards without relying on willpower or constant monitoring.
