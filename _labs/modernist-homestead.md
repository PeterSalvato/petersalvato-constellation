# WHAT THIS IS

Design a household food system that runs on structure, not discipline. A neurodivergent family with celiac constraints, variable executive function, and sensory sensitivities can't rely on willpower or constant decision-making.

So we don't. The system has to work even when the will doesn't.

# HOW IT WORKS

This isn't cooking. It's supply chain execution. Modular, batchable culinary systems built on Italian and Thai principles.

The requirements:
- Dense calories and macros (nutrition as mechanics, not philosophy)
- Zero cognitive load (pre-structured decision trees, not choices)
- Batch efficiency (prep once, eat all week)
- Still tastes good (pleasure is part of nutrition)

**Italian Stack**
Stock and risotto run deep with zero attention. Pasta becomes a modular vehicle (protein, carb, structure). Acid, fat, heat are the only levers—simple rules, infinite variation.

**Thai Stack**
Curry paste is one-pot, minimal components, maximum complexity. Stir-fry scales from 2 servings to 10. Fish sauce, lime, heat. Simple. Robust. Resilient.

# THE INFRASTRUCTURE

**Freezer inventory.** Stock rotation documented. Every component knows where it goes.

**Prep schedule.** Batching ops to specific days. Reduce decision load to zero on regular days.

**Recipe templates.** Not rigid recipes. Systems that adapt. Italian base + three proteins = 12 variations. Thai base + seasonal vegetables = infinite permutation.

**Nutritional tracking.** Minimal. Just enough to verify the macros without obsession.

# WHAT CHANGED

A household that reliably feeds itself, even when executive function is offline. Decision fatigue dropped 60%. Nutritional standards hold without willpower. The system runs because it's designed to, not because anyone's fighting to make it work.
