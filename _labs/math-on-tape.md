# WHAT THIS IS

A live environment where you learn mathematics by doing something. Tape-based metaphors—recording, playback, looping—make abstract ideas physically graspable.

The premise: mathematics should feel like something, not something explained.

# HOW IT WORKS

Tactile operations. Temporal structures. You interact with pattern and rhythm, and that teaches you something true about how numbers work.

Number theory through pattern. Geometry through spatial organization. Sequences through iteration. Transformation through movement.

Accessible rigor. Complex ideas made honest without gatekeeping.

# WHAT'S BUILT

Core modules live. Number theory, harmonic relationships, pattern generation. It's a teaching tool. People use it.

# STATUS

Live. Operational. Works.
