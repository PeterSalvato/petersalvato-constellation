# 1.0 THE CONCEPT

**Math On Tape** is a live environment for exploring the intersection of mathematical reasoning, musical structure, and pedagogical clarity.

The project uses tape-based metaphors (recording, playback, looping) to make abstract mathematical concepts physically graspable.

# 2.0 THE SYSTEM

Core principles:
- **Tactile mathematics** - Mathematical operations rendered as physical interactions
- **Temporal structures** - Using duration and repetition to convey mathematical relationships
- **Accessible rigor** - Complex ideas made intellectually honest without being academically gatekept

# 3.0 CONTENT

The system explores:
- Number theory through pattern and rhythm
- Geometric relationships through spatial organization
- Sequence and series through iteration and accumulation
- Transformation through translation, rotation, reflection

# 4.0 CURRENT STATE

Live environment operational with core modules for basic number theory, harmonic relationships, and pattern generation. Used as a primary teaching tool for mathematically curious audiences.
