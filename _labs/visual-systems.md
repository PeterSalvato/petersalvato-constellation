# 1.0 THE FRAMEWORK

**Visual systems are not collections of colors and fonts. They are operational frameworks.**

A visual system defines how visual decisions get made at scale. It establishes constraints (rules) and provides mechanisms for generating novelty within those constraints.

# 2.0 METHODOLOGY

Visual systems research examines:
- **Constraint hierarchies** - What rules are inviolable? What rules are flexible?
- **Scalability patterns** - How do systems survive team growth and organizational change?
- **Decision frameworks** - How do designers make consistent choices without explicit guidance on every pixel?

# 3.0 APPLICATIONS

This research feeds directly into:
- Brand identity system architecture
- Design operations workflows
- Design token systems
- Governance protocols for distributed teams

# 4.0 CURRENT FOCUS

Research into the relationship between mathematical constraint (golden ratio, modular scale) and perceived visual harmony across different media (digital, print, environmental).
