# WHAT THIS EXPLORES

Visual systems aren't color and font libraries. They're operational frameworks—how decisions get made at scale.

The question: How do teams maintain visual coherence without constant gatekeeping? What rules are actually inviolable? Which can bend? How does a system survive team changes, organizational growth, format migration?

# HOW IT WORKS

Looking at constraint hierarchies. Scalability patterns. How designers make consistent choices without pixel-level guidance.

The thread running through: the relationship between mathematical constraint (golden ratio, modular scale) and perceived visual harmony. How it works differently in digital, print, environmental space.

# WHERE IT FEEDS

This research doesn't stay theoretical. It becomes:
- Architecture for brand systems
- Design ops workflows
- Design token structures
- Governance frameworks for distributed teams

# STATUS

Ongoing. Building frameworks that actually work, then testing them at scale.
