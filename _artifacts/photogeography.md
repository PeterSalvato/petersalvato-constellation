## The Work

Archive of systematic visual storytelling through photography. Original conception: 35mm Minolta-only, locked 3:2 aspect ratio. As project evolved, discovered contradiction: the device mattered less than what was *seen and felt*. Required reframing from format-fidelity to perception-first approach.

## The Implementation

### The Conceptual Reframe

**Option Rejected 1**: Force all images into 3:2 frame (produces dishonest crops)

**Option Rejected 2**: Abandon form-logic entirely (breaks elegant grid system)

**Option Selected 3**: **Format-as-Honest-Evidence**

> "Photogeography respects the shape in which the image arrived. Each image is preserved as seen—square, vertical, or wide. Because this isn't about the world—it's about how I met it."

### Aspect Ratio Specification (Locked)

**Three Allowed Formats**:
1. **3:2 landscape** (original 35mm Minolta; also standard phone aspect)
2. **4:3 landscape or vertical** (most modern phones; observational frame)
3. **1:1 square** (intentional/native crops; internal notation/moment of stillness)

**Optional** (if needed): 9:16 vertical (tall shots), 2:3 vertical

### Visual Metaphor Assignment (Semantic Mapping)

- **3:2**: "Field recording" (observational, evidence-based)
- **4:3**: "Observational frame" (moment of attention)
- **1:1**: "Internal notation" or "Moment of stillness" (contemplative, reflective)

### Modular Container System (Visual Cohesion)

Each image placed in **framed container** (like specimen tray or pinned artifact).

**Standardized Elements Across All Containers**:
- Fixed padding rules (consistent white-space breathing room)
- Subtle background tone or texture layer
- Optional border stroke or shadow line
- Caption placement standardized by format

### Completion Roadmap

**Phase 1 - Foundation**:
- [ ] Finalize project description (one-liner + poetic manifesto)
- [ ] Select final image set from mixed sources (35mm + phone)
- [ ] Assign layout & format per image (3:2, 4:3, 1:1 decision)
- [ ] Confirm production use case (web gallery, zine, prints, etc.)

**Phase 2 - Editorial Layer**:
- [ ] Develop title and caption structure (location, date, poetic fragment?)
- [ ] Write accompanying essay, field notes, or intro text
- [ ] Establish voice/tone (weathered field guide, poetic realism, etc.)

**Phase 3 - Production**:
- [ ] Scan and edit images (standardize color, tone, texture if needed)
- [ ] Size images to print resolution (if physical output planned)
- [ ] Design visual system: typography placement, color treatments, effects (halftone/grain preservation)
- [ ] Create locked layout templates for each aspect ratio

**Phase 4 - Publishing**:
- [ ] Determine web presentation (standalone page, within portfolio, interactive structure)
- [ ] Decide on physical format if applicable (zine, prints, boxed set, digital-only)

## The Result

Evolved **Photogeography from medium-constrained archive to perception-driven system**.

Created **principled flexibility**: three locked aspect ratios honor both form-system aesthetics and honest image-presentation.

Established **philosophical coherence**: project now reads as deliberate design choice, not format accident.

Positioned **within portfolio ecosystem**: Format variation becomes a feature, not a bug—signals that this project prioritizes experience over medium purity.

Developed **actionable completion path** with clear decision gates and modular container specifications.

## Technical Specifications

**Aspect Ratios** (Locked): 3:2, 4:3, 1:1 (optional: 9:16 vertical, 2:3 vertical)

**Source Devices**: 35mm Minolta film + modern smartphone (device-agnostic approach)

**Container System**: Framed specimen-tray format with standardized padding, background texture, border/shadow optional

**Visual Metaphors**: 3:2=field recording, 4:3=observational frame, 1:1=internal notation

**Cohesion Strategy**: Color grading consistency, grid layout discipline, caption standardization, optional texture layer (grain, halftone, vignette)

**Typography System**: Not yet finalized; to be designed in Phase 3 alongside placement rules

**Color Treatment**: TBD based on editorial direction; likely film-stock aesthetic or archival tone

**Captions**: Format TBD (location + date only? Poetic fragments? Field notes?)

**Web Presentation Options**: Scroll gallery, click-through lightbox, fixed grid, interactive map (location-based)

**Physical Output**: Not yet committed; digital-first with optional zine/print production
