## The Work

Natural deodorant line launch required: (1) brand name validation and trademark clearance, (2) label design communicating premium/natural positioning while maintaining regulatory compliance, (3) logomark refinement—original asterisk was reading as editorial footnote rather than "sparkle/premium" signal.

## The Implementation

### Brand Naming & Legal Architecture

**Trademark Strategy**: "Everyday Gold" positioned as **suggestive/arbitrary** (not descriptive, thus inherently registrable in Class 3—cosmetics/deodorants).

**USPTO Search**: Confirmed no deodorant-category conflicts; existing uses only in jewelry sector.

**Messaging Clarification**: "Gold" is metaphorical ("gold-standard daily ritual"), not literal ingredient.

**Domain Strategy**: Prioritize everydaygold.com + consistent social handles (@everydaygold_deo).

### Label Design System (Swiss-Inspired Minimalism)

**Information Hierarchy**:
- **Logotype** (top): Warm, loose script conveying handcrafted care
- **Product Name** (center): Geometric monospaced face for scent variants (e.g., "SWEET DAWN")
- **Claims** (secondary tier): "Luxuriously Effective," "Sensitively Scented," "Baking Soda Free Balm"
- **Regulatory Ring** (outer edge): Ingredients, warnings, batch codes, certification icons at ~6pt

**Substrate & Layout**:
- Central alignment with generous white-space
- Cream background (#F5F3ED est.)
- Muted olive-gray text (#6B7B7F est.)
- Circular die-cut, 3.5" diameter (typical 2oz tin lid)
- Contrast validation: WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 minimum)

### Logomark Evolution (Iteration Documentation)

**Problem Identified**: Original 6-point asterisk felt like typographic notation (footnote marker) rather than visual symbol.

**Solution Development**:
1. Explored three approaches: simplified bullet/dot, star icon, custom ligature
2. Selected geometric 4-point star (vs. 5-point) because:
   - Eliminates acute angles that blur at small scales (~3mm on tin)
   - Reads unmistakably as "sparkle" not notation
   - Even stroke weight matching script strokes (~0.45em relative weight)

**Final Specification**:
- 0.8em width
- Rotated 30° (echoes grid system used in weight rotation)
- 0.15em side margins
- 0.45em stroke weight

### Production Path

- Foil stamping or debossing for star symbol
- Offset printing for base label
- Color-matched cream stock
- Modular scent-variant system: Each scent receives custom monospaced product name (e.g., SWEET DAWN, CITRUS BLOOM, WOODSMOKE)

**Optional Enhancement**: Metallic gold foil accent (spot UV) to reinforce "gold" concept without waste.

## The Result

Achieved **legally clearable brand name** with emotionally resonant metaphor ("gold-standard daily ritual").

Designed **Swiss-style minimalist label** balancing warmth (script logotype, cream palette) with precision (geometric typography, grid alignment).

Resolved **logomark ambiguity** through deliberate design system—star now signals premium/sparkle rather than editorial reference.

Created **modular scent-variant system** ready for production—system scales to additional scents seamlessly.

Integrated **regulatory compliance** without visual clutter—ingredients and warnings designed to same spec as primary content.
