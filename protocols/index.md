title: Protocols
description: "Systems for thinking. Frameworks built because existing tools failed under load. Each protocol solves a structural problem—context recovery, symbolic governance, multi-agent coordination, infrastructure autonomy—with the same rigor applied to enterprise platforms."

## Systems for Thinking

Protocols are governing logic. Not theories—tools built to solve real constraints.

| Protocol | What It Solves |
|----------|---------------|
| Savepoint Protocol | Context recovery across cognitive resets |
| Order of the Aetherwright | Symbolic governance for creative coherence |
| AI DevOps Workbench | Multi-agent coordination through structural impossibility |
| Portable Agency | Digital autonomy through local-first infrastructure |

The same discipline that stabilizes a 12-year enterprise platform applies here. These aren't separate from the production work—they're what makes the production work possible.
