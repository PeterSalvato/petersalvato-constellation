## Systems Applied Across Domains

Practice is where the methodology gets tested outside commercial pressure. Same rigor, different materials.

| Domain | What It Proves |
|--------|---------------|
| **Narrative** | |
| New City | 40+ entity world-building with mechanics as theme |
| Echo & Bone | Archetypes as structural engineering |
| **Visual Taxonomy** | |
| Cryptozoology | Grid systems create credibility for imaginary subjects |
| Motorology | Technical precision as respect for engineering |
| Monstrum | Cultural encoding through creature architecture |
| **Format Constraint** | |
| Photogeography | Locked formats force compositional integrity |
| Versagrams | Typography + AI as co-authors |
| Sentimentology | Swiss grids map emotional terrain |

The proof: systems thinking isn't domain-specific. It's a discipline that applies to enterprise platforms, brand identity, household operations, visual taxonomy, and narrative world-building.
