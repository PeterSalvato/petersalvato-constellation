# Three Systems

The work produces three kinds of output. Not departments. Not roles. Output channels through a single foundational discipline: Visual Communication.

Typography is the chassis. Hierarchy is the load path. Everything else builds on top.

## 1. Narrative Systems

Brand story. Strategic positioning. World-building. **Narrative Solvency** — the infrastructure that ensures a narrative holds together when it moves from concept to deployment.

This isn't copywriting. It's structural integrity of the story itself. The brand's "why" gets encoded into the UX architecture, the design system, the technical logic. It survives constraint because it's load-bearing, not decorative.

**The Problem:** Most brands lose their story when execution hits constraints. The messaging doesn't match the experience. The positioning fractures across touchpoints.

**The Solution:** Encode narrative logic into operational systems. In Aiden Jae, "accessible luxury" isn't a tagline — it's baked into photography, Shopify UX, product grid logic. In Altrueism, "radical transparency" drives the information architecture and visual hierarchy. In New City, a knowledge graph holds the narrative. The story is the system.

**When It Works:** Companies hiring "brand storytellers" at $200k+ aren't looking for copywriters. They need someone who can build the narrative infrastructure — the systems that ensure the story doesn't break when it hits technical reality. That's Narrative Systems.

**Examples:** Aiden Jae, Altrueism, Everyday Gold, New City, Order of the Aetherwright, Modernist Homestead

## 2. Visual Systems

Identity. Typography. Design systems. The visual language that makes a brand or world coherent across contexts.

This is where the SVA lineage shows up directly. Swiss grid systems. Typographic hierarchy as information architecture. Visual form as load-bearing structure. Every project uses some form of Visual Systems — from Aiden Jae's luxury brand identity to The Deep Cuts' high-density concert posters to Encore's 12-year design system.

**The Discipline:** Visual Systems answer "How does the eye parse this?" Whether it's regulatory constraints as design material (Everyday Gold), a format-locked visual archive (Photogeography), or a parametric typographic system (Versagrams), the work treats visual form as structural logic, not decoration.

**The Foundation:** This sits directly on top of Visual Communication discipline. The same principles that held a 10,000-sheet print run hold a 12-year enterprise system. Precision. Constraint. Load paths. Visual coherence under pressure.

**Examples:** Aiden Jae, The Deep Cuts, Versagrams, Encore, Photogeography, Echo & Bone, Everyday Gold

## 3. Technical Systems

Engineering. UX architecture. Platforms. Infrastructure. The code and systems that make it actually work.

This is the "full-stack engineering" half. Encore: 12 years, 40K+ users, 99.9% uptime. Savepoint Protocol: CLI tool for cognitive scaffolding. Portable Agency: homelab infrastructure. Modernist Homestead: household operational systems. MathOnTape: signal flow protocols applied to music.

**The Approach:** Technical Systems aren't isolated from Narrative and Visual. They're co-designed. The brand story informs the UX logic. The typographic system constrains the component library. The technical constraints shape the narrative. When all three systems work together, the result is **granular fidelity** — the idea and the infrastructure are the same thing.

**Examples:** Encore, Savepoint Protocol, Portable Agency, Modernist Homestead, AI DevOps Workbench, MathOnTape

## Narrative Solvency

The term matters. Companies hiring "brand storytellers" don't just need someone who can write compelling copy. They need someone who can build the **narrative infrastructure** — the systems that ensure the story doesn't break when it moves from strategy to deployment.

That's the intersection of all three systems:
- **Narrative** (the story logic)
- **Visual** (the identity expression)
- **Technical** (the engineering implementation)

Working together to create brands and products where the intent survives execution.

**Proof:** Aiden Jae. Altrueism. Everyday Gold. Modernist Homestead. These aren't just "designed" — they're **narratively engineered**. The story is load-bearing.
