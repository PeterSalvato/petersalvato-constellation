# Three Systems

The work produces three kinds of output. Not departments. Not roles. Output channels.

All three channel through Visual Communication — the foundational discipline learned at SVA. Typography is the chassis. Hierarchy is the load path. The rest builds on top.

## 1. Narrative Systems

Brand story. Strategic positioning. World-building. The infrastructure that ensures a narrative holds together when it moves from concept to deployment.

This isn't copywriting. It's **Narrative Solvency** — building the systems that prevent brand drift when the story hits technical reality. The brand's "why" gets encoded into the UX architecture, the design system, the technical logic. It survives constraint because it's structural, not decorative.

### The Problem

Most brands lose their story when marketing hands off to product. The messaging doesn't match the experience. The positioning fractures across touchpoints.

### The Solution

Narrative Systems treat story as infrastructure. In Aiden Jae, "accessible luxury" isn't a tagline — it's encoded in the photography system, the Shopify UX, the product grid logic. In Altrueism, "radical transparency" drives the information architecture and visual hierarchy. The story is the system.

### Examples

- **Aiden Jae** — Luxury positioning encoded into e-commerce
- **Altrueism** — Philanthropic transparency as operational structure
- **New City** — Kishōtenketsu narrative cycles nested within Hero's Journey
- **Order of the Aetherwright** — Symbolic framework as design governance
- **Modernist Homestead** — Household operations as narrative infrastructure

## 2. Visual Systems

Identity. Typography. Design systems. The visual language that makes a brand or world coherent across contexts.

This is where the SVA lineage shows up most directly. Swiss grid systems. Typographic hierarchy as information architecture. Visual form as load-bearing structure. Every project uses Visual Systems — from Aiden Jae's luxury brand identity to high-density concert posters to Encore's 12-year enterprise UI.

### The Discipline

Visual Systems answer "How does the eye parse this?" Whether it's a circular perfume label with regulatory constraints, a parametric typographic system, or a format-locked visual archive, the work treats visual form as structural logic.

### Examples

- **Aiden Jae** — Luxury brand identity and visual hierarchy
- **Versagrams** — Typography + AI-generated imagery under constraint
- **Photogeography** — Format-locked visual archive
- **Cryptozoology** — Swiss grid system for mysterious subjects
- **Motorology** — Technical blueprint aesthetics for vehicles
- **Everyday Gold** — Regulatory information as design material
- **Encore** — Enterprise design systems at 12-year scale
- **Echo & Bone** — Archetypal visual language

## 3. Technical Systems

Engineering. UX architecture. Platforms. Infrastructure. The code and systems that make it actually work.

This is the full-stack engineering half of the practice. Encore serving 40K+ users with 99.9% uptime. Savepoint Protocol as a CLI tool for cognitive scaffolding. Portable Agency as local-first homelab infrastructure. AI DevOps Workbench for multi-agent governance. Modernist Homestead as household operating systems.

### The Approach

Technical Systems aren't built in isolation from Narrative and Visual. They're co-designed. The brand story informs the UX logic. The typographic system constrains the component library. The technical constraints shape the narrative. When all three systems work together, the result is **granular fidelity** — the idea and the infrastructure are the same thing.

### Examples

- **Encore** — Enterprise platform with 99.9% uptime over 12 years
- **Savepoint Protocol** — Semantic version control for cognitive state
- **Portable Agency** — Digital autonomy through local infrastructure
- **AI DevOps Workbench** — Deterministic governance for multi-agent workflows
- **Modernist Homestead** — Household infrastructure under constraint
- **MathOnTape** — Signal flow engineering applied to music composition

## Narrative Solvency

The term matters.

Companies hiring "brand storytellers" don't just need someone who can write compelling copy. They need someone who can build the **narrative infrastructure** — the systems that ensure the story doesn't break when it moves from strategy deck to production deployment.

That's the intersection of all three systems. Narrative (the story logic), Visual (the identity expression), and Technical (the engineering implementation) working together to create brands and products where the intent survives execution.

### Proof

Aiden Jae. Altrueism. Everyday Gold. Modernist Homestead. These aren't just "designed" — they're **narratively engineered**. The story is load-bearing.
