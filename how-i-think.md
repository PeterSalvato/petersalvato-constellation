# How I Think

This is the method. Not theoretical. Actual questions I ask on every project, regardless of domain.

## The Five Questions

When facing a structural problem, I work through these consistently:

### 1. Where is the structural fragmentation?

What's actually broken? Not the surface symptom. The underlying fragmentation.

**Savepoint Protocol:** Recursive drift—the quiet loss of coherence in thought across multiple parallel conversations.

**Aiden Jae:** The gap between craftsmanship (weeks of work) and digital representation (thumbnail on a screen). Luxury drowns in that gap.

**Modernist Homestead:** Willpower-dependent processes fail when executive function is disrupted. Systems can't depend on willpower to function.

**Everyday Gold:** Regulatory requirements treated as constraint bolted onto design, rather than as material that can carry the brand story.

The diagnosis is always: *What's fragmenting here that looks like it's just a surface problem?*

---

### 2. What constraint would concentrate meaning?

Constraints don't limit. They clarify. They force specificity.

**Photogeography:** If you can't crop, you must compose differently. If you can't adjust aspect ratio, you must position differently. Fixed formats force the eye to see differently.

**Versagrams:** What if typography and imagery were locked in constraint together? Instead of image decorating type or type labeling image, what if both were constrained to the same structural requirements?

**The Deep Cuts:** What if the constraint was "teach DJing as active listening"? That forces the methodology to be about structural understanding, not performance tricks.

**New City:** What if you used Kishōtenketsu (perspective recalibration) instead of Western three-act structure? Because this story is about how the protagonist reads systems, not how she overcomes obstacles.

The question is always: *What limitation would force the right clarity?*

---

### 3. Is this authentic or compensatory?

Am I solving the structural problem or working around it? Is this choice earned or convenient?

**Altrueism:** A nonprofit claiming transparency while using polish and marketing language is compensatory. Transparency has to be structural. So: hand-drawn marks, slightly imperfect, showing the work. The roughness *is* proof.

**Order of the Ætherwright:** The Ætherwright as persona could be escapist (hiding behind a character) or integrative (understanding it as a psychological structure that serves you). Integration requires Jungian clarity about boundaries.

**Portable Agency:** Running infrastructure locally because it's trendy is compensatory. Running it locally because you refuse digital dependency is authentic. The question: what are you actually committed to?

The choice is always: *Is this solving the real problem or avoiding it?*

---

### 4. Can this work without the tool?

If the specific tool changes, platform disappears, or technology shifts, does the principle survive?

**Savepoint Protocol:** Works on paper. Works in plaintext. Works in any format. The tool is incidental. The principle (marking inflection points in thinking) is portable.

**Encore:** If Shopify changes their API, does the approach still work? Yes, because the principle is "incremental refactoring" not "Shopify customization." It's about method, not platform.

**MathOnTape:** Signal flow as compositional principle works in Ableton, Logic, hardware, or analog tape. The tool changes. The principle persists.

The test is always: *Does this survive the tool changing?*

---

### 5. What integration point would unify this?

Where can disparate elements cohere as a single thing instead of separate parts layered on top of each other?

**Aiden Jae:** Photography and code aren't separate (design on top of engineering). They're unified: both exist to make the viewer believe the craft is real.

**Altrueism:** Visual identity and operational systems aren't separate. The same principle (transparency as structure) drives both. They cohere.

**Modernist Homestead:** Cooking, health protocols, and executive function scaffolding aren't three separate systems. They're unified by: "the environment does the thinking instead of depending on willpower."

**AI DevOps Workbench:** Governance and multi-agent orchestration aren't separate. They're unified by: "governance the AI cannot alter."

The search is always: *Where can these come together as one system instead of layered systems?*

---

## How This Works

**On every project:**

1. Diagnose the structural fragmentation (not the surface)
2. Ask: what constraint concentrates meaning here?
3. Verify the approach is authentic, not compensatory
4. Ensure the principle survives tool changes
5. Find the integration point

**Result:** A system that's:
- Grounded in the actual problem
- Simplified by constraint
- Honest about what it solves
- Resilient to change
- Unified rather than layered

## Examples Across Domains

The method scales because it's about diagnosis, not domain:

**Narrative:** New City (story structure unified with protagonist survival mechanic)
**Visual:** Photogeography (format as teaching tool)
**Technical:** Encore (incremental refactoring as architectural approach)
**Infrastructure:** Portable Agency (local ownership as principle)
**Personal Systems:** Modernist Homestead (environment does the thinking)

Same five questions. Different domains. Same result: coherence.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a framework I invented. It's what emerged from doing the work consistently and noticing the pattern.

It's not a guarantee. It's a method. Sometimes you diagnose wrong. Sometimes the constraint you choose doesn't concentrate meaning. Sometimes authentic turns out to be harder than compensatory.

But the method helps you catch those moments and recalibrate before you've built the wrong thing.

---

## Why This Matters

Strategic thinking across narrative, visual, and technical requires a consistent diagnostic method. You can't just shift between domains and hope for coherence.

The same thinking that diagnoses a brand positioning gap (Aiden Jae) can diagnose a composition problem (MathOnTape) or an infrastructure problem (Portable Agency) because the method isn't domain-specific.

That's what makes strategic thinking transferable. It's not about knowing more. It's about asking consistent questions.
