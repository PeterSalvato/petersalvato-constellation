# THE DOCTRINE

## Operating Principles

### 1. Sovereign Architecture
I do not "hand off" systems. I maintain them. Tenure is the architecture.

### 2. Logic + Taste
Rigorous engineering must be coupled with visual governance. The absence of either produces mediocrity.

### 3. The Fire of Maintenance
Anyone can launch. Few can maintain. Maintenance is where the work lives.

### 4. High Information Density
Respect the user's attention. Show them what they need, when they need it, without ceremony.

### 5. Operationalize Intuition
"Taste" is not subjective. It is a trainable skill governed by principles that can be systematized.
