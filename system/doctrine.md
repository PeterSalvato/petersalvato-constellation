# THE DOCTRINE

## Operating Principles

### 1. Tenure Is the Architecture
I don't hand off systems. I maintain them. Twelve years on one platform isn't stagnation — it's proof the architecture holds. Anyone can launch. The work is in what survives.

### 2. Structure Before Style
Rigorous engineering and visual governance aren't separate skills. They're the same discipline applied to different materials. A system without structure is decoration. Structure without craft is a spreadsheet.

### 3. Constraints Are the Material
A neurodivergent family isn't a hardship — it's the design constraint that produced Savepoint Protocol. A 12-year tenure isn't limitation — it's the load test. The best systems are built from honest constraints, not aspirational requirements.

### 4. Respect the Reader's Time
High information density. No ceremony. Show what's needed, when it's needed. If the first paragraph can be removed without losing anything, remove it.

### 5. Build for the Next Architect
Every system should be operable by someone who didn't build it. Plan for succession. Document decisions. If it's not written down, it didn't happen.
