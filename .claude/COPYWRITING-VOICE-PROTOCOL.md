# Copywriting Voice Protocol: Craftsman Mentor

## Core Principle

**Show, don't tell. Lead with action. Assume the apprentice can learn from watching.**

This is the voice of a craftsman woodworker mentor talking to an apprentice. You demonstrate the work. You don't explain the methodology. You speak from thirty years of doing, not from theory.

## Voice Signature

**The Pattern:**
1. Demonstrate what happens (action)
2. Show the result or consequence
3. Trust the apprentice to understand
4. No explanation layer required

**Example of Wrong (Tell):**
> "The process requires establishing intent upfront and then maintaining fidelity to it throughout execution using documented systems."

**Example of Right (Show):**
> "You start by figuring out what you're saying. Then you maintain that through every visual and technical decision. The ones that hold—that's the proof the fidelity stayed."

## Core Rules

### 1. Lead with Action, Not Description

❌ **Tell:** "The methodology involves deep consultation to understand client needs."

✅ **Show:** "You have a conversation. You listen to how they feel about what they're building."

### 2. Use Concrete Verbs, Not Abstract Ones

❌ Tell: process, approach, implement, leverage, utilize, optimize

✅ Show: run it through, figure out, hold up, land, break, craft, maintain

### 3. Show Consequence, Not Explanation

❌ **Tell:** "Brand vocabulary prevents messaging drift by maintaining consistency across touchpoints."

✅ **Show:** "Brands that hold had a vocabulary and someone maintained fidelity to it. Brands that fracture lost the narrative somewhere between strategy and execution."

### 4. Speak to the Apprentice, Not the Audience

- Use "you" when demonstrating
- Use first person when showing your own work
- Never use corporate plural ("we believe," "we help")
- Assume the reader is ready to learn by watching

✅ "You start by..." (demonstrating to apprentice)
✅ "I've learned..." (authority from experience)
❌ "We provide..." (distance, corporate)
❌ "One must..." (false formality)

### 5. Ground Everything in What Actually Happens

❌ **Tell:** "Strategic positioning creates competitive advantage in luxury markets."

✅ **Show:** "In Aiden Jae, 'accessible luxury' isn't a tagline. It's in the photography system, the Shopify UX, the product grid logic. That's why it survives contact with reality."

### 6. Authority Through Confidence, Not Credentials

Don't claim expertise. Demonstrate it.

❌ "As a systems architect with 30 years of experience..."

✅ "Twelve years keeping a platform alive while everything around it changed teaches you something: the hard part isn't building it. It's keeping it running."

### 7. Use Material/Structural Language

❌ Tell: solutions, innovation, transformation, paradigm, synergy

✅ Show: holds, breaks, drifts, scaffolding, fidelity, load, joints, structure, craft, strokes

### 8. No Theater or Performance

Remove:
- Hype language ("groundbreaking," "revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Rhetorical questions used for effect
- Motivational framing
- Aspirational language

Keep:
- Matter-of-fact statements
- Practical consequences
- What actually works
- Why it matters (through demonstration, not explanation)

## Rhythm and Pacing

The voice has rhythm. It's conversational but not casual.

**Sentence variation:**
- Short declarative statements (authority)
- Medium explanatory sentences (showing)
- Longer causal chains (why it matters)

✅ Good:
> "You start by having a real conversation. You listen to how someone feels about what they're building. What they think is valuable about it. What they want people to feel when they encounter it—not what they want them to think, what they want them to *feel*. There's a difference."

Short. Shorter. Then a longer explanation that demonstrates the distinction.

❌ Bad:
> "Initial consultation involves active listening to stakeholder sentiment, value proposition articulation, and desired emotional outcomes, which are differentiated from cognitive perception targets."

Flat. Explanation without rhythm. No demonstration.

## Demonstration Technique

**The Pattern for Showing:**

1. **State what you do** (action)
   > "You have a conversation."

2. **Show what you're listening for** (demonstration)
   > "You listen to how someone feels about what they're building. What they think is valuable. What they want people to feel."

3. **Show the consequence** (proof)
   > "That distillation—that's your vocabulary. Everything else comes from there."

4. **Show what breaks without it** (why it matters)
   > "Brands that fracture lost the narrative somewhere between strategy and execution."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Wrong | Right |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Tell instead of show** | "This process maintains narrative consistency" | "You evaluate outputs against initial intent. Does it still say what we said?" |
| **Explain instead of demonstrate** | "The methodology ensures fidelity through systematic documentation" | "You maintain fidelity through visual and technical guard rails. The vocabulary holds it." |
| **Abstract verbs** | "We process client input through our framework" | "You run that understanding through thirty years of knowing design" |
| **Distance instead of presence** | "One must establish intent upfront" | "You start by figuring out what you're saying" |
| **Credentials instead of work** | "With two decades of experience..." | "Twelve years keeping a platform at 99.9% uptime teaches you..." |
| **Hype language** | "Groundbreaking narrative architecture" | "Brands that hold had a vocabulary someone maintained fidelity to" |
| **Explanation layer** | "This prevents drift by..." | "Drift happens when..." / "The ones that hold..." |

## Voice Markers (What Sounds Right)

Listen for these markers in your draft:

✅ **Sounds Right:**
- Specific numbers, durations, metrics (12 years, 99.9% uptime, 40,000+ users)
- Material/structural vocabulary (holds, breaks, drifts, joints, load, scaffold)
- Active voice demonstrating action
- Confidence without performance
- Practical consequence
- Matter-of-fact tone

❌ **Sounds Wrong:**
- Vague modifiers (innovative, unique, comprehensive, transformative)
- Abstract methodology language
- Explanation of how something works
- Distance ("we," "one," passive construction)
- Hype or aspirational framing
- Corporate tone

## Examples: Converting Generic to Craftsman Voice

### Example 1: Narrative Solvency

**Generic (Tell):**
> "Narrative Solvency is a comprehensive framework for ensuring brand messaging maintains consistency across technical implementation while preserving strategic intent through coordinated visual and technical systems."

**Craftsman Voice (Show):**
> "Most brand stories break when they hit technical reality. The narrative was solid in the strategy deck, but somewhere between design and engineering, the story fractures. Narrative Solvency means you make the narrative decisions upfront and then maintain fidelity to them through visual and technical systems. The story survives because it's structural."

**What changed:**
- Showed the problem (stories break)
- Showed the consequence (story fractures at handoff)
- Showed what you do (make decisions, maintain fidelity)
- Showed why it matters (story survives if it's structural)
- No explanation of what the framework is

### Example 2: Visual Communication Foundation

**Generic (Tell):**
> "Visual Communication represents a foundational discipline combining Swiss grid systems, typographic hierarchy, and information architecture principles to create structurally sound design systems."

**Craftsman Voice (Show):**
> "At SVA, I didn't learn graphic design as decoration. I learned that typography is load-bearing. That visual form is structural. You can't build durable interfaces without understanding typographic hierarchy. You can't architect brand systems without understanding visual grammar. That's the foundation everything else sits on."

**What changed:**
- Showed what was learned (typography is load-bearing)
- Showed why it matters (can't build durable things without it)
- Used personal experience (I learned)
- Demonstrated through consequence (you can't do X without Y)
- No theory, just what actually works

### Example 3: Technical Systems

**Generic (Tell):**
> "Technical Systems encompass the engineering infrastructure, platform architecture, and implementation frameworks that enable sustained operational fidelity and scalability across complex deployment scenarios."

**Craftsman Voice (Show):**
> "Technical Systems are what keep the story alive under real conditions. Encore ran for 12 years at 99.9% uptime with zero catastrophic failures. 40,000+ users. 2.5 million annual transactions. That's not because the code was perfect. It's because every technical decision was made to hold the narrative and visual fidelity intact while the system scaled."

**What changed:**
- Showed what Technical Systems do (keep story alive under load)
- Used concrete proof (12 years, uptime, scale metrics)
- Explained consequence, not methodology
- No explanation of what systems are, just what they accomplish

## Process for Rewriting Copy

1. **Read the draft** - Listen for "tell" vs "show"
2. **Identify explanation layers** - Where are you explaining instead of demonstrating?
3. **Find the action** - What actually happens? Start there.
4. **Show consequence** - What breaks without this? What happens when it works?
5. **Remove explanation** - Trust the apprentice to understand from watching
6. **Check rhythm** - Vary sentence length. Is it conversational?
7. **Listen for hype** - If it sounds impressive but not grounded, it's wrong
8. **Verify tone** - Does it sound like a mentor talking to an apprentice, or a consultant explaining methodology?

## When to Use This Voice

✅ **Use this voice for:**
- Project descriptions and case studies
- Positioning copy and about pages
- Methodology explanations
- Brand narrative articulation
- Explaining how you work
- Three Systems framework and related concepts

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Technical documentation (separate voice)
- Contact forms or transactional copy
- Navigation labels
- Testimonials (those should be customer voices)

## Red Flags - Stop and Rewrite

If you see these, rewrite:

🚩 "Our approach..."
🚩 "We believe..."
🚩 "This methodology..."
🚩 "The process involves..."
🚩 "Leveraging..."
🚩 "To optimize..."
🚩 "Innovative solutions..."
🚩 "Transformative..."
🚩 Any sentence that explains how something works instead of showing what happens
