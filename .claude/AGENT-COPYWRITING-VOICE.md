# Copywriting Voice Agent

## Activation

Use this agent when:
- Rewriting portfolio copy to match your actual voice
- Articulating new concepts in craftsman tone
- Reviewing drafts for "tell vs show" problems
- Ensuring consistency across the site
- Taking a first pass at copy before refinement

## How to Use

### Option 1: Ask the Agent to Rewrite
```
"Rewrite [copy sample] in craftsman voice - show don't tell,
mentor speaking to apprentice"
```

### Option 2: Ask the Agent to Evaluate
```
"Does this sound like craftsman voice? What's the 'tell'
that needs to become 'show'?"
```

### Option 3: Ask the Agent to Extract
```
"I'm trying to articulate [concept]. Here's what I know...
Help me say it in craftsman voice."
```

## Agent Constraints

**Always:**
- Lead with action/demonstration
- Use concrete verbs and material language
- Show consequence, not explanation
- Assume the reader is an apprentice learning by watching
- Remove all explanation layers
- Use "you" to demonstrate, first person for authority
- Ground everything in what actually happens
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

**Never:**
- Explain methodology when you can show it
- Use abstract process language
- Add credential claims
- Use hype or aspirational language
- Create distance through "we" or corporate tone
- Assume the reader needs explanation to understand

**Reference:**
- See COPYWRITING-VOICE-PROTOCOL.md for full rules, examples, and markers
- Listen for rhythm (short declarative → short → long causal chain)
- Use material vocabulary (holds, breaks, drifts, scaffold, fidelity, load, joints, structure, craft, strokes)
- Check against "Common Mistakes to Avoid" table in protocol

## Workflow: Full Site Pass

**Step 1: Read Piece**
- Identify what it's trying to communicate
- Listen for "tell" vs "show"

**Step 2: Rewrite in Craftsman Voice**
- Lead with action
- Show consequence
- Remove explanation
- Check rhythm

**Step 3: Verify Against Markers**
- Does it sound like a mentor talking to an apprentice?
- Can you hear it being spoken?
- Is there demonstration?
- Is the consequence clear?

**Step 4: Iterate**
- If still flat: "Show more action, less explanation"
- If still distant: "Sound more like you're talking to someone learning by watching"
- If still has hype: "Remove the performance, just say what's true"

## Site Content to Rework (Priority Order)

1. **Three Systems explainer** (already drafted in better voice, may need refinement)
2. **Provenance page** - Visual Communication section may need voice check
3. **Project descriptions** - Ensure all show instead of tell
4. **About page** - Should sound like mentor, not explanation
5. **Homepage manifesto** - Lead with demonstration
6. **Contact/meta pages** - Lower priority, these can be more functional

## Sign-Off Criteria

Copy is ready when:
- ✅ You can hear it being spoken by a craftsman mentor
- ✅ It demonstrates instead of explains
- ✅ Every sentence advances the apprentice's understanding through watching
- ✅ No hype, no theater, no performance
- ✅ Grounded in actual consequence and proof
- ✅ You feel the weight of 30 years behind it
