# PETER SALVATO
## Systems Architect

I build systems, type, interfaces, and tools. Usually by hand. Always with intent.

Twelve years of work that didn't break when the pressure increased.

---

## EVIDENCE

Long projects. Systems that scaled through constraint, not luck.

### [The Encore Platform](/evidence/the-encore-platform)
**12 years** | 99.9% uptime | Mission-critical SaaS

Replacing the engine while the car drives at 60mph. A study in what happens when you refuse to break the rules just because they're old.

### [Visual Governance](/evidence/visual-governance)
**Identity systems** | Coherence at scale

Luxury brands, commerce platforms. How identity stays coherent when teams grow and pressure increases.

---

## LABS

Problems worth solving twice. Experiments with form and logistics.

### [New City](/labs/new-city)
**Narrative simulation** | 40+ entity graph

Infrastructure stress test. What happens when the system fails? A fictional city built to understand collapse.

### [Modernist Homestead](/labs/modernist-homestead)
**Family systems** | Zero-willpower operations

How to design a life that runs on structure, not discipline. Neurodivergent logistics. Supply chains for resilience.

### [Visual Systems](/labs/visual-systems)
**Design research** | What survives change

Visual systems that hold through organizational drift.

### [Math On Tape](/labs/math-on-tape)
**Signal processing** | Tactile mathematics

Making abstract ideas physically graspable. Education as material practice.

---

## PROTOCOLS

Tools I needed. Methods that scale because they're built on clarity.

### [Savepoint](/protocols/savepoint)
**Operational stability** | Moments of recovery

How to architect stability into complex systems. Documented recovery.

### [Order of the Aetherwright](/protocols/order-of-the-aetherwright)
**Systems doctrine** | Clarity, consistency, coherence

The discipline of designing systems that exist only on paper and in practice.
