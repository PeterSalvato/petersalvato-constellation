# THE APPRENTICESHIP

## Construction Sites

I started on job sites. My father built things — framing, concrete, finish work. Before I understood design theory or information architecture, I understood load paths. I understood that a structure either holds or it doesn't, and the difference is in the joints.

That's still how I think about systems. The interesting question is never "what should this look like?" It's "where does this fail?"

## SVA and Print Shops

I went to the School of Visual Arts in New York. Studied graphic design — not the Photoshop-and-portfolios version, but the Swiss-grid, typographic-hierarchy, information-density version. Learned to think about visual systems as structural systems. Learned that typography is load-bearing.

Between classes, I worked in print shops. Offset presses. Prepress production. The kind of work where a misaligned registration mark wastes a thousand sheets of paper. Precision wasn't a value — it was a material constraint.

## Twelve Years at Cluen

After New York, I became the Principal Architect at Cluen Corporation. The Encore Platform — a recruitment management system serving 40,000+ users across Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies.

Twelve years is a long time to stay with one system. Long enough to see three technological epochs come and go. Long enough to learn that the hard part isn't building something — it's keeping it alive while everything around it changes.

I didn't do a big rewrite. I wrapped legacy .NET infrastructure in modern React interfaces. Replaced the engine while the car was moving. The Strangler Fig pattern — not because it's fashionable, but because it respects institutional knowledge and uptime.

99.9% uptime over 12 years. Zero catastrophic failures. 2.5 million annual transactions. That's not a portfolio piece. That's a structural proof.

## The Neurodivergent Household

My family runs on systems because it has to. ADHD, autism, and executive function challenges across the household mean that willpower-dependent processes fail. If breakfast prep takes 90 minutes of decision-making, the family doesn't eat.

So I built systems. Savepoint Protocol started here — documenting moments of stability so you can return to them when things drift. The Modernist Homestead started here — zero-willpower household systems where structural defaults replace decision fatigue. Culinary modularity across five traditions. Celiac health navigation. Executive function scaffolding. The family operates on structure, not willpower.

These aren't side projects. They're the same structural discipline applied to a different domain. A system either holds under load or it doesn't. The domain is irrelevant. The engineering is the same.

## The Unified Practice

What connects construction sites and code architecture, print shops and protocol design, enterprise platforms and family meal systems:

Every one of these is a problem of structural integrity. Of building something that holds up under pressure, over time, when the people operating it are tired or distracted or new to the job.

I don't draw a line between professional and personal work. The systems I build for clients use the same principles I developed to keep my household running. The voice protocol I use to write this site follows the same constraint logic I use to architect a database migration.

It's all building. The materials change. The discipline doesn't.
