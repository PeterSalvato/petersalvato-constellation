# Process Archives

## How This Work Gets Built

These archives document the thinking, decisions, and constraints behind each project. They show:

- **Key decisions made** — Why choices were made, what alternatives were considered
- **What didn't work** — Experiments that failed, how we fixed them, what we learned
- **Technical architecture notes** — Platform choices, integration approaches, scaling considerations
- **Constraints that shaped everything** — How specific limitations drove innovation and clarity

---

## The Five Core Case Studies

Each archive is 1500-3000 words. Read in any order, or follow your interests.

### Savepoint Protocol - Process Archive

Context leak kills teams. Capture intent. Index cognitive state. Document why decisions were made.

**What you'll find:**
- Why CLI-first approach, not GUI
- Decision: Semantic versioning for memory anchors
- What failed: Automated context capture (too complex)
- Technical: Git + JSON metadata layers
- Constraint: Neurodivergent workflow patterns

### Aiden-Jae - Process Archive

Handmade jewelry meets e-commerce. How do you make a platform believe your work is real?

**What you'll find:**
- Why photography and code are unified system
- Decision: Grid variance based on visual weight
- What failed: Lifestyle photography (contradicted authenticity)
- Technical: Custom Liquid templates, responsive SCSS
- Constraint: Shopify limitations became positioning advantage

### Order of the Aetherwright - Process Archive

Scale kills coherence. How do you maintain unified vision across multiple teams and platforms?

**What you'll find:**
- Why symbolic governance, not procedural rules
- Decision: Frames and Reels structure
- What failed: Over-abstraction in early versions
- Technical: JSON story space mapping
- Constraint: Complexity requires shared language

### New City - Process Archive

Speculative worldbuilding. What happens when you let systems emerge instead of authoring them?

**What you'll find:**
- Why modular systems, not narrative-first design
- Decision: 40+ entity relationship graph
- What failed: Circular dependencies in entities
- Technical: Cryptographic puzzle generation
- Constraint: Card-based mechanic integration

### Modernist Homestead - Process Archive

Household as operating system. How do you build infrastructure for a neurodivergent family?

**What you'll find:**
- Why local-first infrastructure, not cloud-dependent
- Decision: Growing systems for food and autonomy
- What failed: Complexity overwhelm (v1 was too ambitious)
- Technical: Docker containerization, local storage, Homelab compute
- Constraint: Executive function limitations became design driver

## Why These Archives Exist

Process archives answer: **"How was this decision made? What constraints shaped it? What didn't work?"**

They're for builders and practitioners who want to understand methodology, not just results. They show that systems work because they're built on accumulated thinking—not luck or intuition.

## How to Read Them

**Scanners:** Read the key decisions (bullet format) to understand major choices quickly.

**Deep readers:** Read narrative explanations to understand context and constraints.

**Practitioners:** Look for applicable patterns to your own work.
