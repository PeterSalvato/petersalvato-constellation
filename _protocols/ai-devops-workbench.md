## Deterministic Governance for Non-Deterministic Systems

Throw a prompt at ChatGPT and you get output. Do it again and you can't reproduce it. Bring in multiple agents and nobody knows what happened or why. Context vanishes. Hallucination compounds.

This is the problem: AI is powerful but unstructured. You need governance architecture.

The AI DevOps Workbench provides hard constraints for multi-agent workflows. Not to limit capability. To create reproducibility, traceability, provenance.

## The Infrastructure

**institutional-memory-enforcer.js:** Detects architectural drift before it spreads.

**test-think-tool.js:** Pre-execution reasoning gate. The agent thinks aloud before acting.

**conventions.md:** Hard guardrails. Rules the agents can't break.

**Stack:** JSON prompting (configuration as code). Multi-agent orchestration (choreography, not chaos). Context window optimization (respect the limits).

## The Proof

Structured AI collaboration with traceable provenance. Every decision documented. Every reasoning step visible. You can audit what happened. You can reproduce results. The system is operationally sound.
