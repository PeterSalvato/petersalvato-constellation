## Deterministic Governance for Non-Deterministic AI

A structured environment for managing multi-agent AI workflows.

## The Infrastructure

institutional-memory-enforcer.js: Architectural drift control. test-think-tool.js: Pre-execution reasoning gate. conventions.md: Hard guardrails. Stack: JSON prompting, multi-agent orchestration, context window optimization.

## The Narrative

Not "AI tools" but "Governance Architecture for AI." Most teams experience AI drift—hallucination, context loss, inconsistent reasoning. The Workbench solves this through structural constraints.

## The Result

Structured AI collaboration with traceable provenance and reduced context drift.
