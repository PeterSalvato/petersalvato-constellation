## Cognitive Scaffolding

After 14 days on a complex problem, you can't remember why you made a decision. After a crisis or hospital visit, the project context evaporates. This is cerebral leak. It collapses work.

Savepoint Protocol captures intent before it disappears. You index your mental state. Document the decision gates. Seal the context window. When you return, you recover at full coherence, not from scratch.

## The System

Not "note-taking." Semantic version control for thought. A protocol designed for neurodivergent operators and long-form creative work where context drift is fatal.

Iterated through three syntaxes: YAML (v1.0) → XML-style tags (v3.0). CLI tool (sp) extracts savepoints from logs. The philosophy: "Sovereign Cognition."

## The Proof

Teams using Savepoint recover faster from failures. Decisions get bolder when fallback is documented, not theoretical. The person returning to the work at day 27 knows exactly where day 1 made the critical choice.

## The Result

Fully documented protocol (v3.0) with open-source CLI tooling ready for deployment. Used across teams in creative, technical, and operational contexts.
