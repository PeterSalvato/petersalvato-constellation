## Cognitive Scaffolding

Version control protocol for thought and cognitive state-indexing. Functions as a "Save Game" for executive function, allowing the operator to index a mental state before context-switching.

## The Narrative

Not "note-taking" but "Semantic Version Control." A system designed specifically to solve for "Cerebral Leak"—the loss of high-fidelity context across long-form, non-linear cognitive cycles.

## The Implementation

Syntax Evolution: Iterated from YAML (v1.0) to XML-style tag (v3.0). CLI tool (sp) to extract savepoints from logs. Philosophy: "Sovereign Cognition."

## The Fix

Teams that use Savepoint recover faster from failures. Decisions get bolder when fallback is documented, not theoretical.

## The Result

Fully documented protocol (v3.0) and CLI tool ready for deployment.
