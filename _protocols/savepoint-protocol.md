## What It Is

A savepoint is a documented moment of stability. In games, you save before the hard part so you can return to a known-good state when something breaks. In real work — engineering, creative, household — you need the same thing.

Context is the first thing to go. In a meeting, after a vacation, during a reorg, on a bad executive-function day. The thread disappears. Savepoint Protocol is the system that keeps it visible.

## How It Works

### Engineering Projects
- Define decision points before refactors, deployments, schema changes
- Document state: code snapshot, database, config, rationale
- Create rollback paths: revert scripts, restoration procedures
- Execute, verify, archive

### Households
- Weekly check-ins documenting patterns — meals, sleep, mood, friction points
- Monthly reviews to catch problems before they become crises
- Quarterly adjustments: if breakfast prep takes 90 minutes of decision-making, the system needs redesign
- Annual audits: are we still solving the right problem?

### Creative Work
- Define stability criteria — not "done," just "stable enough to branch from"
- Save intermediate states, not just the final version
- Document what's working so you don't accidentally erase it
- Keep decision history — why this direction, not that one

## The Requirements

**Clarity.** Know what "stable" actually means in your context.

**Documentation.** Write it down. Don't hold it in your head. Heads are unreliable.

**Automation.** If savepoints require manual work, they won't happen consistently.

**Verification.** Periodically test the rollback. A backup you've never restored is a theory, not a system.

## What Changes

Teams that do this recover faster from failures. They make bolder decisions because fallback is documented, not theoretical. They keep institutional memory through turnover.

It works because the structure does the work — not people's willpower, not their memory, not their good intentions on a bad day.
