# WHAT IT IS

A savepoint is a documented moment of stability. In games, you can return to a known good state if the next decision breaks everything. In real work, you need the same thing.

# IN PRACTICE

**Engineering projects:**
- Define decision points (before refactors, deployments, schema changes)
- Document state (code snapshot, database, config)
- Create rollback paths (revert scripts, restoration procedures)
- Execute and archive

**Households:**
- Weekly check-ins documenting patterns (meals, sleep, mood)
- Monthly reviews to catch problems before crisis
- Quarterly adjustments (if breakfast prep takes 90 minutes, it will fail)
- Annual audits (are we still solving the right problem?)

**Creative work:**
- Define stability criteria (not "done," just "stable")
- Save intermediate states (not just the final version)
- Document what works (you don't want to erase it accidentally)
- Keep decision history (why this direction?)

# THE REQUIREMENTS

**Clarity.** Know what "stable" actually means.

**Documentation.** Write it down. Don't hold it in your head.

**Automation.** If savepoints require manual work, they won't happen.

**Verification.** Periodically test the rollback. Make sure it actually works.

# WHAT CHANGES

Teams that do this recover faster from failures. They make bolder decisions because fallback is documented, not theoretical. They keep institutional memory when people leave.

It works because the structure does the work, not people.
