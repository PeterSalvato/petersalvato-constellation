## The Work

A savepoint is a documented moment of stability. In games, you save before the hard part so you can return to a known-good state when something breaks. In real work — engineering, creative, household — you need the same thing.

Context is the first thing to go. In a meeting, after a vacation, during a reorg, on a bad executive-function day. The thread disappears. Savepoint Protocol is the system that keeps it visible. It applies across engineering projects, households, and creative work — anywhere decisions compound and memory fails.

## The Approach

Define stability before you need it. A savepoint isn't "done" — it's "stable enough to branch from." The protocol operates the same way in every domain:

1. **Define decision points** before the risky work begins — refactors, deployments, schema changes, household system redesigns, creative direction shifts
2. **Document state** at each point: code snapshot, database, config, rationale — or the household equivalent: meals, sleep, mood, friction points
3. **Create rollback paths** — revert scripts, restoration procedures, archived intermediate states
4. **Verify periodically** — a backup you've never restored is a theory, not a system

The protocol scales from weekly household check-ins to quarterly system audits to annual re-evaluations. The cadence changes. The discipline doesn't.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Domains applied | 3 (engineering, household, creative) |
| Review cadence | Weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual |
| Version | V3.0 — Open Source |
| Core requirements | 4 (clarity, documentation, automation, verification) |
| Recovery principle | Structure-dependent, not willpower-dependent |

## What It Proves

Teams and families that do this recover faster from failures. They make bolder decisions because fallback is documented, not theoretical. They keep institutional memory through turnover.

It works because the structure does the work — not people's willpower, not their memory, not their good intentions on a bad day.
