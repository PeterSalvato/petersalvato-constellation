## Local-First Infrastructure

Homelab-based infrastructure for digital autonomy. Local/offline specialist agent system for autonomous consulting.

## The Narrative

Not "home server setup" but "Infrastructure for Autonomy." Dependence on cloud-only stacks creates risk. Your family infrastructure runs locally—media, backups, AI compute—works when the internet doesn't.

## The Fix

Local compute stacks, offline data sovereignty, network-agnostic infrastructure.

## The Result

Family infrastructure runs locally with zero cloud dependency. This is the ultimate test of systems thinking.
