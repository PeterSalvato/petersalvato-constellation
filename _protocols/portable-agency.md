## Local-First Infrastructure

Everything lives in the cloud now. One ISP outage. One corporate policy shift. One algorithm change. One financial decision by a company that doesn't know your name. The entire infrastructure disappears.

This is the problem: digital dependency.

Portable Agency fixes it. You own the infrastructure. Your compute runs locally. Your data stays with you. The system works when the internet doesn't.

## The Approach

This isn't a hobby. It's how you actually build systems that last.

**What you run locally:** Jellyfin streams your movies. Nextcloud holds your files. Ollama runs AI on your hardware. PostgreSQL stores your data. Everything on machines you control.

**When the internet fails, you don't.** Your infrastructure keeps running. Your files stay accessible. Your work continues.

**It works everywhere.** On your home network. Over a VPN from anywhere. Completely offline. Same system, same reliability, no dependencies.

## The Proof

A family runs on this setup. Zero cloud accounts required. Not a weekend project—it's how they actually live. This is what happens when you stop accepting infrastructure someone else controls and start building your own.
