## Local-First Infrastructure

Everything lives in the cloud now. One ISP outage. One corporate policy shift. One algorithm change. One financial decision by a company that doesn't know your name. The entire infrastructure disappears.

This is the problem: digital dependency.

Portable Agency is the antidote. Infrastructure you own. Local compute. Offline sovereignty. Your data stays with you.

## The Approach

Not "home server hobby." Architectural approach to digital autonomy.

**Local compute stacks:** Jellyfin for media. Nextcloud for files. Ollama for local AI. PostgreSQL for data. Everything runs on hardware you control.

**Offline sovereignty:** When the internet disappears, the infrastructure still works.

**Network-agnostic:** Works on LAN. Works over Tailscale VPN. Works offline.

## The Proof

Family infrastructure runs locally with zero cloud dependency. Not a side project. An operational lifestyle change. This is what it looks like when systems thinking gets applied to personal autonomy.
