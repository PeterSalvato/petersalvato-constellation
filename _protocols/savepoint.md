# 1.0 THE PROTOCOL

**A savepoint is a documented moment of stability in a complex system.**

In narrative games, a savepoint allows you to return to a known good state if the next decision leads to catastrophe. In complex projects, savepoints are just as critical.

# 2.0 APPLICATION

### Engineering Projects
- Define clear decision points (before major refactors, deployments, schema changes)
- Document the system state (code snapshot, database state, configuration)
- Create a rollback path (revert script, data restoration procedure)
- Execute the savepoint (commit, tag, archive)

### Family Systems
- Weekly check-ins that document household patterns (meals, sleep, mood)
- Monthly reviews to identify emerging problems before crisis
- Quarterly deep dives to adjust systems (if breakfast prep takes 90 min, it will fail)
- Annual audits (are we still solving the right problem?)

### Creative Work
- Define scene completion criteria (not "done," but "stable")
- Save the intermediate state (not just the latest draft)
- Document what works (so you don't erase it in the next revision)
- Create decision history (why did we choose this direction?)

# 3.0 THE DISCIPLINE

Savepoints require:
1. **Clarity** - Know what "stable" looks like
2. **Documentation** - Write it down, don't hold it in your head
3. **Automation** - Savepoints that require manual work will be skipped
4. **Review** - Periodically verify your savepoints still work (test the rollback)

# 4.0 OUTCOME

Teams that practice savepoints recover faster from failures, make bolder decisions (because fallback is documented), and maintain institutional memory across member transitions.
