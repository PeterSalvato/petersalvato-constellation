# WHAT THIS IS

The Aetherwright designs systems that exist between the physical and digital. Process systems. Knowledge systems. Organizational structure.

This documents the discipline required to make those systems actually work.

# THE THREE PILLARS

**Clarity**
Systems must be intellectually transparent. Ambiguity is debt. Every rule needs a reason. Every exception needs documentation.

**Consistency**
Systems that survive are predictable. People operate them without constant recalibration. Consistency builds trust.

**Coherence**
The system must be logically sound. Changes in one area cascade through dependent areas without contradiction. Incoherent systems generate hidden debt and friction.

# THE PRINCIPLES

Start with constraints. Define what cannot happen before optimizing what should.

Make implicit decisions explicit. Document decision points and decision criteria.

Build feedback loops. Systems that can't measure themselves can't improve.

Plan for succession. Assume you won't be here. Design for the next architect.

# IN PRACTICE

Weekly system reviews (do we still need this rule?)

Quarterly audits (is this still coherent?)

Annual re-authorization (should this system continue?)

Continuous documentation (if it's not written down, it didn't happen)
