## The Problem

When a creative system relies on semi-mystical language—Frames, Reels, Glyphs—without sufficient internal rigor, terms risk semantic drift. Users interpret the same glyph differently over time. Coherence fractures. New people cannot join because it demands intense front-loading of philosophy and symbol-set digestion. Without continuous external policing of meaning, meanings blur. Without a governed process for amending the taxonomy, the system either ossifies (becomes brittle) or fragments (users invent divergent private versions).

## The Structure

**Eight-glyph naming system** — Every folder name encodes its structural purpose. Red glyphs mark logic. Green mark expression. Blue mark utility. Unambiguous. Searchable. Structure communicates intent before you read a single word.

**Codex** — Functions as central repository (akin to alchemical grimoire). Encodes the glyph system, tenets, rituals, and ledger of recognized practitioners. This is the source of truth. Not negotiable.

**Threefold Path** — Structures all creative work as three sequential phases: Deconstruction, Iteration, Synthesis. Every project moves through these phases. The structure is external to the project itself, making progress visible.

**Ritual of Attention** — Uses glyphs to visibly track effort across phases. Identifies primary versus peripheral focus. Makes effort allocation visible. The Æ Sigil marks earned achievement, not claimed identity.

## How It Works

Before starting a project, answer: "What is the ONE question this solves?" Write it in scope.md. Everything in the project serves that question or gets deleted. Use glyphs to label folders, creating unambiguous structure that survives interpretation drift. During work, track intensity across Threefold Path phases using Ritual of Attention (glyph notation), making effort allocation visible.

The Steward guards the Codex and recognizes practitioners who embody the system—role emerges from consistent practice, not invitation. Savepoint Protocol + Order together create interlock: Savepoint manages the "why" and "when" (timestamped reflection). Codex tracks the "what" and "how" (structural encoding). You cannot advance without both.

## What It Survived

12-year solo platform (Encore): Zero context loss during crises. Recovered full decision context in 1 hour during 2-week hospital stay instead of 3 days. Portfolio projects gain hidden symbolic architecture—viewers sense structure without explicit explanation. Framework explicitly distances itself from persona or branding, preventing semantic capture by audience interpretation.

Used on real projects with measurable coherence across portfolio constellation—petersalvato.com, aetherwright.com, project documentation naming conventions, glyph metadata all aligned without external governance needed.

## What This Proves

Structure survives scale and personnel change. Meaning persists because it's encoded structurally, not enforced through personality or authority. A new person joining the system learns the glyphs and immediately understands the work's architecture. The dyadic system (Savepoint + Order) creates institutional memory that lives outside individual knowledge and survives crises.
