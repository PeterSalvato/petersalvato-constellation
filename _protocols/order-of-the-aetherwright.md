## What It Is

The Aetherwright builds systems that exist between the physical and digital — process systems, knowledge systems, organizational structure. The kind of architecture you can't point at but everyone depends on.

This documents the discipline required to make those systems hold.

## The Three Pillars

### Clarity
Systems must be intellectually transparent. Ambiguity is structural debt. Every rule needs a reason. Every exception needs documentation. If you can't explain why a constraint exists, you've inherited someone else's assumption — and assumptions rot.

### Consistency
Systems that survive are predictable. People operate them without constant recalibration. Consistency isn't rigidity — it's the property that builds trust. When the system behaves the same way twice, the people inside it can stop watching the system and start doing their work.

### Coherence
The system must be logically sound as a whole. Changes in one area cascade through dependent areas without contradiction. Incoherent systems generate hidden debt — the kind that doesn't show up until someone asks "why does this break when I change that?"

## The Principles

**Start with constraints.** Define what cannot happen before optimizing what should. Constraints are the foundation. Features are the furniture.

**Make implicit decisions explicit.** Document decision points and decision criteria. The most dangerous architecture is the kind nobody remembers choosing.

**Build feedback loops.** Systems that can't measure themselves can't improve. Every process needs a way to surface its own failures.

**Plan for succession.** Assume you won't be here. Design for the next architect, not for your own comfort.

## In Practice

- Weekly system reviews: does this rule still serve?
- Quarterly audits: is this system still coherent?
- Annual re-authorization: should this system continue to exist?
- Continuous documentation: if it's not written down, it didn't happen
