# 1.0 THE FOUNDATION

**The Aetherwright is an architect of intangible systems.**

This protocol documents the discipline required to design and maintain systems that exist in the space between the physical and digital—systems of process, knowledge, and organizational structure.

# 2.0 THE THREE PILLARS

### Clarity
Systems must be intellectually transparent. Ambiguity is debt. Every rule must have a reason; every exception must be documented.

### Consistency
Systems that survive do so because they are predictable. Team members must be able to operate the system without constant recalibration. Consistency builds trust.

### Coherence
The system must be internally logicaladjustments in one area must cascade coherently through dependent areas. Incoherent systems generate hidden debt and team friction.

# 3.0 PRINCIPLES

1. **Start with constraints** - Define what cannot happen before optimizing for what should happen
2. **Make implicit decisions explicit** - Document decision points and decision criteria
3. **Build feedback loops** - Systems that can't measure themselves can't improve themselves
4. **Plan for succession** - Assume you won't be here to maintain this. Design for the next architect.

# 4.0 PRACTICE

The Order requires:
- Weekly system reviews (do we still need this rule?)
- Quarterly architecture audits (is the system still coherent?)
- Annual re-authorization (should this system continue to exist?)
- Continuous documentation (if it's not written down, it didn't happen)
