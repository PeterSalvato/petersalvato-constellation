## Symbolic Operating System

Conceptual framework and personal creative operating system. The philosophical layer that locks with Savepoint (the technical How).

## The Infrastructure

ScopeForge: Brutalist project-scoping. Constellation: The map of interoperable IP. 8-Glyph Domain System: Symbolic file system. Codex Syntax: Execution syntax for tracking creative phases.

## The Fix

The Order provides the "drivers" that allow abstract thoughts to interface with the physical world. It ensures that when you move from "Expression" to "Engineering," the intent doesn't crash.

## The Locking Mechanism

When locked with Savepoint: Savepoint is the flight recorder. Order is the pilot's manual. Together they ensure Meaning-State Persistence.
