## The Work

Joinery is the framework for how I work with clients. The name is literal — joinery is the craft of connecting pieces so the joint is as strong as the material. In woodworking, a bad joint means the structure fails. In system-building, the joint between design intent and technical execution is where most projects lose fidelity.

Boutique teams don't have enterprise process overhead — sprint ceremonies, design reviews, QA gates. The work moves fast because there's no friction. But the handoff between "what we want" and "what gets built" is still the failure point. Without structural scaffolding, intent drifts into implementation and nobody notices until the product ships wrong.

## The Approach

Three mechanisms bridge the gap:

**Shared Specification.** Every engagement starts with a single document that both design and engineering can read, reference, and update. One source of truth. If the specification doesn't describe it, it doesn't get built.

**Joint Reviews.** Regular checkpoints where design intent is compared against technical implementation. Not design critique. Not code review. Joint review — does the built thing match the specified thing? Where did drift occur? Why?

**Structural Vocabulary.** A shared language for talking about the work. "Drift" means the gap between intent and execution. "Scaffold" means the temporary structure that holds the work in place. "Fidelity" means how closely the output matches the specification. When everyone uses the same words, miscommunication drops.

## The Numbers

|--------|--------|
| Framework components | 3 (specification, review, vocabulary) |
| Applicable domains | 4 (brand, platform, product, content) |
| Deliverables | Shared specs, review cadence, structural vocabulary |
| Integration | Savepoint Protocol, Order of the Aetherwright |
| Target teams | Boutique and high-context |

## What It Proves

The joint is the architecture. A system built by a small team with good joinery holds up as well as one built by a large team with heavy process — and it moves faster because the scaffolding is structural, not bureaucratic.
