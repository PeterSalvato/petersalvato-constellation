## The Work

Joinery is the framework for how I work with clients. The name is literal — joinery is the craft of connecting pieces so the joint is as strong as the material. In woodworking, a bad joint means the structure fails. In system-building, the joint between design intent and technical execution is where most projects lose fidelity.

## The Problem

In enterprise, you have process to manage the handoff — sprint ceremonies, design reviews, QA gates. It's expensive and slow, but it works because the structure forces alignment.

Boutique teams don't have that overhead. A founder, a designer, and an engineer in a room. The work moves fast because there's no process friction. But the handoff between "what we want" and "what gets built" is still the failure point. Without structural scaffolding, intent drifts into implementation and nobody notices until the product ships wrong.

## The Framework

### Shared Specification
Every engagement starts with a shared specification format — not a design doc, not a technical spec, but a single document that both design and engineering can read, reference, and update. One source of truth. If the specification doesn't describe it, it doesn't get built.

### Joint Reviews
Regular checkpoints where design intent is compared against technical implementation. Not design critique. Not code review. Joint review — does the built thing match the specified thing? Where did drift occur? Why?

### Structural Vocabulary
A shared language for talking about the work. "Drift" means the gap between intent and execution. "Scaffold" means the temporary structure that holds the work in place until it can hold itself. "Fidelity" means how closely the output matches the specification. When everyone uses the same words for the same things, miscommunication drops.

## What It Proves

The joint is the architecture. A system built by a small team with good joinery holds up as well as one built by a large team with heavy process — and it moves faster because the scaffolding is structural, not bureaucratic.
