## Brand Remediation for Social Impact

Social impact nonprofit brand remediation. You identified a brand that had drifted from its mission and performed structural realignment.

## The Narrative

Not "graphic design" but "Brand Remediation for Social Impact." Mission-driven organizations face a specific problem: their visual identity doesn't match their operational integrity.

## The Fix

You introduced "Digital Patina"—hand-made marks and stone textures—as proof of material honesty. Trust through Texture.

## The Result

Transformed incoherent brand into premium-positioned system. Structural authority re-established through visual discipline. Work complete; client did not launch due to funding—but the architecture was "Delivered" grade.
