## The Work

Building the operating system for a neurodivergent household. Not a lifestyle project — a systems deployment. The Modernist Homestead is the infrastructure that keeps a family functional when executive function, health constraints, and geographical disruption converge.

Three simultaneous load conditions: ADHD and autism across the household where willpower-dependent processes fail, celiac disease where cross-contamination is a medical event, and cross-border relocation where health systems and supply chains reset completely.

## The Approach

**Culinary Modularity.** A coherent cooking system across five traditions — American BBQ, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Japanese. Four structural elements (umami, acidity, heat, smoke) present across all five. Recipes composed from principles, not memorized. Zero-decision meals assembled without choosing.

**Executive Function Scaffolding.** Savepoint integration with weekly household check-ins. Decision elimination through default meals, schedules, and supply lists. Environmental design reducing cognitive load — tools in reach, ingredients pre-staged, the kitchen as an ergonomic system.

**Health Navigation.** Celiac protocol with supply chain verification and cross-contamination prevention built into kitchen layout. Medical continuity with records, medication schedules, and care provider information structured for portability across jurisdictions.

## What It Proves

The same structural discipline that keeps an enterprise platform stable for 12 years can keep a household running. Constraints aren't limitations — they're design parameters. A neurodivergent family isn't a hardship story — it's the most demanding systems environment I work in.

The family eats. The family relocates. The family operates. That's the proof.
