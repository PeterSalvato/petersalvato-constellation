## The Work

Building the operating system for a neurodivergent household. Not a lifestyle project — a systems deployment. The Modernist Homestead is the infrastructure that keeps a family functional when executive function, health constraints, and geographical disruption converge.

## The Constraints

Three simultaneous load conditions:

**Executive function.** ADHD and autism across the household. Willpower-dependent processes fail. If breakfast prep requires 90 minutes of decision-making, the family doesn't eat. Every system must run on structure, not motivation.

**Celiac and chronic health.** Dietary constraints aren't preferences — they're chemical boundaries. Cross-contamination is a medical event. The food system must enforce these constraints structurally, not through vigilance.

**Geographical independence.** Cross-border relocation means health systems, supply chains, and social infrastructure reset. The household systems must be portable — they can't depend on a specific grocery store, a specific doctor, or a specific school.

## The Systems

### Culinary Modularity

A coherent cooking system across five traditions — American BBQ, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Japanese. The structural logic:

- **Flavor architecture:** Four elements (umami, acidity, heat, smoke) present across all five traditions. Recipes are composed from structural principles, not memorized.
- **Technique overlap:** Fire, fermentation, classical precision, experimental control. Methods transfer across cuisines.
- **Japanese pickles as integrative element:** Shiozuke, asazuke, nukazuke, amazuzuke, shoyuzuke — each connects multiple cuisine families through a single technique.
- **Zero-decision meals:** Preset configurations that can be assembled without choosing. Chemical constraints replace willpower.

### Executive Function Scaffolding

Systems that work when the operator is depleted:

- **Savepoint integration:** Weekly household check-ins documenting patterns. Monthly reviews catching drift before crisis. Quarterly adjustments for systems that aren't holding.
- **Decision elimination:** Default meals, default schedules, default supply lists. The structure makes the decision so the person doesn't have to.
- **Environmental design:** Physical space organized to reduce cognitive load. Tools in reach. Ingredients pre-staged. The kitchen as an ergonomic system, not a willpower test.

### Health Navigation

- **Celiac protocol:** Supply chain verification. Cross-contamination prevention built into kitchen layout, not daily vigilance. Safe-food database maintained and portable.
- **Medical continuity:** Health records, medication schedules, and care provider information structured for portability across jurisdictions.

## What It Proves

The same structural discipline that keeps an enterprise platform stable for 12 years can keep a household running. Constraints aren't limitations — they're design parameters. A neurodivergent family isn't a hardship story — it's the most demanding systems environment I work in.

The family eats. The family relocates. The family operates. That's the proof.
