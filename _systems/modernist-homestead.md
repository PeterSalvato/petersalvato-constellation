## The Work

This isn't a lifestyle project. It's systems engineering applied to household operations.

Three simultaneous load conditions:

**Executive Function:** ADHD and autism across the household. Willpower-dependent processes fail under load. If breakfast prep takes 90 minutes of decision-making, the family doesn't eat. If systems depend on remembering to remember, they collapse.

**Health:** Celiac disease where cross-contamination is a medical event, not an inconvenience. One contaminated meal triggers weeks of pain.

**Geography:** Cross-border relocation where health systems reset, supply chains change, and institutional knowledge evaporates overnight.

## The Approach

**Culinary Modularity.** A coherent cooking system across five traditions — American BBQ, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Japanese. Four structural elements (umami, acidity, heat, smoke) present across all five. Build any meal from the same handful of principles. No recipe hunting. No "what's for dinner" paralysis. Monday's braise becomes Wednesday's taco filling becomes Friday's rice bowl. Same technique, different tradition.

**Executive Function Scaffolding.** Weekly household check-ins that function like savepoints in a game—a fixed moment to catch problems before they cascade. Default meals eliminate choice fatigue. Default schedules eliminate negotiation. Supply lists are printed and staged. The kitchen layout itself does the work: tools in reach, prep surfaces cleared, ingredients pre-portioned. Cognitive load moves from your brain into the environment.

**Health Navigation.** Celiac protocol built into kitchen geography, not into willpower. Separate prep surfaces. Separate tools. Supply chains verified at purchase. Medical records, medication schedules, and care provider contacts structured for portability—you relocate, your medical continuity relocates with you. Institutional knowledge becomes transferable knowledge.

## What It Proves

The same structural discipline that keeps an enterprise platform stable for 12 years can keep a household running. Constraints aren't limitations — they're design parameters. A neurodivergent family isn't a hardship story — it's the most demanding systems environment I work in.

The family eats. The family relocates. The family operates. That's the proof.
