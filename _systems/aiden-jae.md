## The Work

Aiden-Jae is a woman-led luxury fine jewelry brand founded by Randi Salvato — 20+ years of industry experience. The challenge: establish market position against premium competitors (Mejuri, Catbird) while building a brand architecture that treats sustainability as structure, not decoration.

## The Approach

### Positioning

The brand promise: **Consciously Crafted Fine Jewelry.** Premium aesthetics with environmental and ethical responsibility built into the material specification, not bolted on as marketing copy.

### Competitive Architecture

Three-tier comparison framework:

**Mejuri:** DTC mass-market. Vermeil and plated. High volume, lower price point. Sustainability is secondary messaging.

**Catbird:** Artisanal Brooklyn-made. Solid gold. Curated designer focus. Sustainability implicit but not primary.

**Aiden-Jae:** Premium minimalist. 100% recycled solid gold. Transparent sourcing. Measurable environmental impact — carbon savings, water conservation, certified donations.

### Material Specification

- **Gold:** 100% recycled 9K/14K yellow gold. RJC-certified partner facilities.
- **Stones:** Conflict-free, ethically sourced. Small-batch partnership model.
- **Sustainability metrics:** 1% annual sales to Pollinator Partnership. Carbon-neutral shipping. Eco-friendly packaging.
- **Price range:** $55–$420 with 1-year manufacturing warranty.

### Growth Strategy

1. Product expansion into entry-level accessible pieces
2. Content infrastructure — artisan profiles, care guides, design process
3. Partnership architecture with sustainability-focused creators
4. Loyalty and referral mechanics
5. Transparency amplification — certifications, source stories, impact metrics
6. Retail extension via eco-conscious urban pop-ups

### Design Language

Nature-inspired. Banyan roots, celestial motifs, ocean themes. Minimalist and symbolic rather than literal.

**Collections:** Banyan, Star Light Star Bright, Sunrise Sunset, Minis, Knotted Tropics.

## What It Proves

Competitive differentiation secured through material commitment, not messaging. 100% recycled solid gold, transparent sourcing, symbolic design language, and measurable environmental impact — each one a structural decision, not a marketing angle.

Brand architecture scales across consumer segments from daily-wear to investment pieces. Growth roadmap honors brand values while expanding reach.
