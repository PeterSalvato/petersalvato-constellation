## Retail Brand Architecture

Built a jewelry e-commerce system from the ground up. The work bridges two worlds that don't usually talk to each other: a craftsperson's hands and a customer's screen.

## The Problem

The friction was real. A jeweler spends weeks on a ring. A customer sees a thumbnail. That gap—between the object and its digital shadow—is where luxury drowns. So instead of bolting design onto an off-the-shelf platform, we built the entire visual and technical system as one thing. Photography, product pages, inventory logic, checkout flow. All designed to move the feeling of craftsmanship through a wire.

## The Fix

High-resolution photography that shows texture—the grain of a stone, the weight of metal in light. Then custom Liquid templates and SCSS that lets those images breathe. No shortcuts. No stock templates hiding behind placeholder copy. The code and the photography had to do the same job: make you believe a real person made this.

## The Result

Premium pricing held. Sourcing practices that were once a footnote in the about page became visible in every product detail—not because we marketed them harder, but because the system made them visible by default. The structure proved the story was real.
