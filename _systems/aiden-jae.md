## The Work

Aiden-Jae is a woman-led luxury fine jewelry brand founded by Randi Salvato — 20+ years of industry experience. The challenge: establish market position against premium competitors while building a brand architecture that treats sustainability as structure, not decoration.

The brand promise: **Consciously Crafted Fine Jewelry.** Premium aesthetics with environmental and ethical responsibility built into the material specification, not bolted on as marketing copy.

## The Approach

**Competitive Architecture.** Three-tier comparison framework against Mejuri (DTC mass-market, vermeil and plated) and Catbird (artisanal Brooklyn-made, solid gold). Aiden-Jae occupies the third position: premium minimalist, 100% recycled solid gold, transparent sourcing, measurable environmental impact.

**Material Specification.** 100% recycled 9K/14K yellow gold through RJC-certified partners. Conflict-free, ethically sourced stones. Carbon-neutral shipping. Eco-friendly packaging. 1% annual sales to Pollinator Partnership.

**Design Language.** Nature-inspired. Banyan roots, celestial motifs, ocean themes. Minimalist and symbolic rather than literal. Collections: Banyan, Star Light Star Bright, Sunrise Sunset, Minis, Knotted Tropics.

**Growth Strategy.** Product expansion into accessible entry-level pieces. Content infrastructure with artisan profiles and care guides. Partnership architecture with sustainability-focused creators. Transparency amplification through certifications and impact metrics.
