## Retail Brand Architecture

Brand and technical architecture for luxury jewelry e-commerce. From-scratch build of a visual and technical operating system bridging high-end craftsmanship and digital scalability.

## The Narrative

Not "e-commerce site" but "Architecture of Accessible Luxury." You built a Visual Operating System from scratch to solve a structural problem: luxury brands struggle to translate handmade quality into digital trust.

## The Fix

Established "Visual Vocabulary" via high-fidelity, texture-led photography and custom Liquid/SCSS to bridge the gap between artisanal production and digital presentation.

## The Result

Premium positioning established. Sustainable sourcing becomes a structural advantage, not a marketing claim. The architecture proves the story.
