## The Work

Natural deodorant brand requiring three things at once: trademark clearance, label design that communicates premium positioning while meeting FDA regulatory requirements, and a logomark that reads as "sparkle" instead of "footnote."

## The Build

### Trademark and Legal Architecture

"Everyday Gold" positioned as suggestive/arbitrary — not descriptive, therefore inherently registrable in Class 3 (cosmetics/deodorants). USPTO search confirmed no deodorant-category conflicts. "Gold" is metaphorical: gold-standard daily ritual, not a literal ingredient.

### Label System

Swiss-style minimalism. Information hierarchy:

- **Logotype** (top): Warm, loose script. Handcrafted care.
- **Product name** (center): Geometric monospaced face for scent variants — SWEET DAWN, CITRUS BLOOM, WOODSMOKE.
- **Claims** (secondary): "Luxuriously Effective," "Sensitively Scented," "Baking Soda Free Balm."
- **Regulatory ring** (outer edge): Ingredients, warnings, batch codes, certification icons at 6pt.

Substrate: cream background (#F5F3ED), muted olive-gray text (#6B7B7F). Circular die-cut, 3.5" diameter. WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 minimum contrast).

### Logomark

The original 6-point asterisk read as typographic notation — a footnote marker, not a brand symbol. Replaced with a geometric 4-point star: eliminates acute angles that blur at small scales (~3mm on tin), reads unmistakably as "sparkle," and matches the script's stroke weight (~0.45em).

**Final spec:** 0.8em width, rotated 30°, 0.15em side margins, 0.45em stroke weight.

### Production

Foil stamping or debossing for star symbol. Offset printing for base label. Color-matched cream stock. Modular scent-variant system — each scent gets a custom monospaced product name on an identical underlying label.

## What It Proves

Regulatory compliance isn't a constraint bolted onto the design — it's a design material. The ingredients ring, allergen warnings, and batch codes are specified to the same standard as the logotype and product name. The system treats all information as structural, regardless of whether it's "marketing" or "legal."
