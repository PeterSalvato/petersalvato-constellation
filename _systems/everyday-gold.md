## The Work

Natural deodorant brand requiring three things at once: trademark clearance, label design that communicates premium positioning while meeting FDA regulatory requirements, and a logomark that reads as "sparkle" instead of "footnote."

"Everyday Gold" positioned as suggestive/arbitrary — not descriptive, therefore inherently registrable in Class 3 (cosmetics/deodorants). USPTO search confirmed no deodorant-category conflicts. "Gold" is metaphorical: gold-standard daily ritual, not a literal ingredient.

## The Approach

**Label System.** Swiss-style minimalism with information hierarchy: warm script logotype (top), geometric monospaced face for scent variants — SWEET DAWN, CITRUS BLOOM, WOODSMOKE (center), secondary claims (below), and a regulatory ring (outer edge) carrying ingredients, warnings, batch codes, and certification icons at 6pt.

**Logomark.** The original 6-point asterisk read as typographic notation — a footnote marker, not a brand symbol. Replaced with a geometric 4-point star: eliminates acute angles that blur at small scales (~3mm on tin), reads unmistakably as "sparkle," and matches the script's stroke weight (~0.45em). Final spec: 0.8em width, rotated 30 degrees, 0.15em side margins.

**Production.** Foil stamping or debossing for star symbol. Offset printing for base label. Color-matched cream stock. Modular scent-variant system — each scent gets a custom monospaced product name on an identical underlying label. Circular die-cut, 3.5-inch diameter.

## The Numbers

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Trademark class | Class 3 (cosmetics/deodorants) |
| Label format | Circular die-cut, 3.5" diameter |
| Color palette | Cream (#F5F3ED) / olive-gray (#6B7B7F) |
| Contrast compliance | WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum) |
| Logomark | 4-point star, 0.8em, rotated 30 degrees |
| Scent variants | 3 (Sweet Dawn, Citrus Bloom, Woodsmoke) |

## What It Proves

Regulatory compliance isn't a constraint bolted onto the design — it's a design material. The ingredients ring, allergen warnings, and batch codes are specified to the same standard as the logotype and product name. The system treats all information as structural, regardless of whether it's "marketing" or "legal."

## Why Two Versions?

Everyday Gold exists in both Systems and Practice because the project demonstrates two distinct architectural disciplines:

- **Systems version** (`/systems/everyday-gold`): Operational infrastructure. E-commerce logistics, inventory management, supply chain, and direct-to-consumer fulfillment. The answer to: "How does a brand actually operate at scale?"

- **Practice version** (`/practice/everyday-gold`): Label design and regulatory architecture. Typographic systems, FDA compliance, trademark distinctiveness, and production specifications. The answer to: "How do you encode regulatory requirements as design material?"

Both disciplines must work together. The same structural thinking that holds premium brand positioning in the label holds the operational integrity of the supply chain.
