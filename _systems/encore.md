## Architectural Sovereignty

The 12-year proof of concept. Architectural sovereignty over an enterprise-scale executive search platform serving Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies. Legacy .NET Core desktop architecture migrated to modern web standards without service interruption. Maintained mission-critical platform stability and UX continuity for 100,000+ users across 2.5M+ annual transactions with zero catastrophic failures.

## The Narrative

Not "front-end work" but "Architectural Sovereignty." The proof that you can manage massive technical drift—the widening gap between design intent and technical execution—at enterprise scale.

## The Fix

Custom Atomic SCSS/JS frameworks "grafted" modern Material Design onto routed UI for 100% responsive parity. Refactoring as a metabolic process, not a rebuild.

## The Result

12 years of structural containment. Colossal Data Ingestion managed through constraint-driven architecture. High-fidelity execution maintained through legacy-to-modern migration.

This is what implementation fidelity looks like at scale: not a perfect rebuild, but a durable evolution where the original system doesn't break while being transformed.
