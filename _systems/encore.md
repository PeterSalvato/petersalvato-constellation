## What We Built

Took a 12-year-old .NET Core desktop system and moved it to the web. Served Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies. 100,000+ users. 2.5 million transactions a year. Never broke it in the process.

## The Problem We Solved

Systems drift. You design something one way, then five years of patches and workarounds later, the code doesn't match the original plan anymore. Scale that to enterprise. Add legacy constraints. That gap gets massive. We kept it stable while closing it.

## How We Did It

Built custom SCSS and JavaScript frameworks that let us layer modern Material Design on top of the existing routing system. No rip-and-replace. Just methodical refactoring—replacing one piece while everything else kept working.

Think of it like repairing a ship while it's at sea: you replace the hull planks one section at a time, not all at once.

## What It Meant

Twelve years of unbroken operation. Millions of records flowing through the system continuously. Nothing catastrophic failed. The architecture didn't just survive the modernization—it became more maintainable on the other side.

That's implementation fidelity: not perfect code, but durable execution. Systems that keep working while you're transforming them.
